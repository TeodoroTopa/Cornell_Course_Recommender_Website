The exams are extremely tricky. They totally screwed up my grade and added everything up wrong and now when I am trying to contact them to change it they are just ignoring me. Also, you will learn absolutely nothing important.take this class if you are good at guessing since the quizzes and tests are extremely random.  the TA&#39;s are useless (just like most AEM TA&#39;s) and will tell you the wrong answers in the review sessions.  you should probably just buy take note--thats how i got an A after getting C averages on all of the quizzesgreat guy\/posts slides onlinePerez is an ok guy, and the material is interesting, but somehow he manages to make it incomprehensible.  The tests are disorganized and arbitrary.Professor Perez radiates passion and vigour. He inspires his students to think analytically about business cases. He entertains as well as teaches, and often jumps vigorously on and off tables in a melodramatic fashion. One learns a lot from his classes. A great professor but one who may not always give his undivided attention to his students.his tests are entirely irrelevant to the material so you cant prepare for it at all.  If it was open book and there was no time limit you would still be unsure abot 75 percent of the questionsPedro is a really smart guy but his tests make you hate life. Its not that they&#39;re hard... they&#39;re really not. Its just that they are so freaking confusing that they&#39;ll make you compare fruits to animals (almost literally). I made almost a 100 on one of his tests, and had no idea whether I had done well or not. FYI, the median for that test was 64.Some harsh words from other students, and I don&#39;t know if they are completely warranted.  The tests are tricky (the mid term was at least, not so much the final), but a fair grade is completely attainable if you put forth some effort.  Pedro is a really good guy, and absolutely hilarious.  Take his class, but be prepared to work for your grade.Perez makes absolutely no sense, &amp; neither do his tests.  This is an example of an actual question: &#34;True or False, is it possible to controll the rate of mental &amp; physical decline that comes with age?&#34;  One would think &#34;True&#34; to be the logical answer, but surprisingly this is not the case.  What are doctors for then? &amp; isn&#39;t this an AEM class?this professor shows absolutely no compassion to his students. his only concern is to make a 2 credit class feel like a 4 credit one. ridiculous statements such as the book is wrong are common occurences in this embarassment to cornell university.Very unclear teacher. All questions have multiple CORRECT answers but he doesn&#39;t know that!It&#39;s a good thing there are many guest lecturers, as Perez does little to capture your attention.  Lectures are uninspired, and Perez abdicates responsibility to the TAs for any problems you may have.  He seems unable to make a decision for himself.  Interesting course topic, bad prof!this class is deceptively easy, the midterms is killer and there aren&#39;t tons of opportunities to make up los points. the class material is a waste of time, either you get it or you don&#39;t. do the reading to study for the ridiculously unrelated test.Perez is the worst professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell.He doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing AT ALL - its a waste of life to actually show up to class.The professor favors people who really suck upto him a lot,and never knows what he is talking about.He tries to make it hard by asking sneaky questions &amp; making a big deal of stupid stuff, but u learn nothing.fun and entertaining professor. points come across clearly..easy A with several extra credit opportunities such as viewpoints and experiment participation.Prof Perez is a great guy and he manages to pull off great dynamics in such large lectures.  He writes tricky exams.  The TAs are really helpful so utilize them.  Overall a great introductory class, but it&#39;s not a guaranteed A, and Prof. seems to take a lot of crap because it isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s not very fair of people to complain bcse it isnt an easy A.Class is a waste of time, everything is common sense and incredibly boring. seems like the easiest class until you get to the prelim, which was the most poorly written test I have ever taken, dumb questions on minute concepts, and answers that disagreed with the textbook, made class average terrible.fun and entertaining professor. points come across clearly..easy A with several extra credit opportunities such as viewpoints and experiment participation.It&#39;s an easy A.

Do not take AEM 1200 unless you have to.One of the worst profs at Cornell. His lecturers are extremely opinionated and his tests are just stupid lists that do not help you learn how to manage a business. His teaching is way too theoretical and doesn&#39;t apply to the real world. If you want to learn business management, take a Hotel School course; at least those profs have some experience.Terrible tests... super easy with awfully unfair grading.NOT AN EASY A! He made up a bunch of crap on all his tests - material was never covered in lecture or in books. No way to study for the class OR learn biz! Means for each exam: 79, 77, &amp; 71. Opt project mean = 85. Even w\/ lots of extra credit, the mean grade is B-\/B (not curved). FOR AN INTRO AEM CLASS THIS IS RIDICULOUS! coming from a bio major.Took AEM 1200 in the spring (for non AEM majors). Class material was pretty interesting, but, Perez covered everything pretty quickly - for the sake of the exam rather than teaching. Tests were not challenging but the questions were unclear - most were not covered in class and the textbook. We never even received the correct answers before the finaOne of Cornell&#39;s best.  He may come off as a stickler only because he expects a manageable amount of respect that unfortunately very little students have.  I suggest taking AEM 1200 strongly, he is an excellent guy.easy A+ as it isPretty boring class, pretty easy though. In the spring he gives practice questions on-line. All the material for the 5 in class tests is on them. Do the on-line questions and you&#39;ll do wellPerez is definitely one of the most humorous and knowledgeable people around, but his quizzes&#39; questions can be quite vague and unexpected sometimes. The lectures and books (to a small extent) are helpful, but a good TA helps a lot, especially with cases. Oh, and do participate in class, that&#39;ll help any grade a lot at the end of the course...Pedro is a very interesting and entertaining lecturer. However, his final exam is difficult. He does offer extra credit, which offsets it.Noticeable Spanish accent (humor value?), too much material to cover in a class. Confusing sometimes, explanations are interesting but not useful for the tests. No homework at least until the final project (~50 hours of group work). Ridiculously confusing &amp; difficult tests even with canceled questions. The extra credit is useful and even necessary.He is a better professor than people are giving credit for.  Yeah, some of his questions on the tests are ridiculous, but he manages to keep the class&#39; attention.  He actually purposely raised the classes grade by the end, and the average grade was a 86 which is acceptable.He is probably the worst professor at Cornell. It is ridiculous how the median grade for spring 2010 is hovering around B- range. Even after reading every chapter and taking detailed notes, his tests are biased. Spare yourself the $200+ for textbooks, because the course isn&#39;t worth it. And this is coming from an econ major with straight A&#39;s.Pedro knows his stuff but his tests are hit or miss. It is the questions not the material that are challenging. Not helpful with explaining material. Don&#39;t even buy the book. Your best move is taking this soph\/ jr year after you know the material. He expects you to know the material as well as if you took accting\/mkting. Got an A but bad classThe class was a good class. We had two textbooks but the contents overlapped a lot so it was like reading the same stuff twice. The workload was sometimes overwhelming, especially the final project. He gives extra credit and he is very nice. His quizzes are sometime vague but the cases were fun even though some took a lot of time to do.just want to point out to the poster below me that the average of last spring WAS a B... and this is directly out of the cornell registrar... if you want to be condescending, at least do YOUR research beforehand. I guess it&#39;s true then, Perez does seem unlucky in that he keeps on getting such students.Useless class.  Didnt learn a thing.  As long as you read the simple lists in the textbook you will do fine on the test.  No true knowledge of anything business is actually applied to tests.Pedro definitely needs help when it comes to teaching (even more so, his TAs which seem to come from the same frat or sorority). However, I often felt bad for him because he tends to get the worst students. Even the ones who post here denote a truly sad inability to do basic research... DIRECTLY FROM THE REGISTRAR&#39;S OFFICE: AEM 1200 MEDIAN: B+.Pedro is not a good professor when it comes to learning in class.  He goes into tangents and does not get through all of his material.  His mannerisms are entertaining but distract you from the material.  Overall it would be an easy class if it wasn&#39;t for his subjective tests.  The tests are horribly made and based on his opinions.This is a relatively easy class, be sure to study the lecture notes and definitions of terms prior to exams- notecards definitely help.  And go to the review sessions, they actually tell you what to study so you don&#39;t waste your time reading over everything.  The tests are somewhat arbitrary though, and Pedro is a terrible professor.don&#39;t take it unless you have to. not hard to get an A, but you can definitely spend your time somewhere else. this class is.... NOT worth it. i have learned NOTHING!hard to understand. can be an okay class, but you have to work for it. exams are somewhat arbitraryPedro&#39;s class is not very straightforward in terms of his expectations or material that is covered. That being said, I did poorly on my prelims, but still ended up with a good grade because I went to class and got all of the extra credit opportunities. Not a great class experience while you&#39;re in it but you will be surprised with your gradeIf you want a good grade for this class, try to get on your TA&#39;s good side instead of the professor. Go to as many office hours (especially your TA&#39;s) for the case studies as possible and you are sure to get something in the A range. The class is very easy if you come in with some background knowledge in finance.Heavy workload. And I just don&#39;t understand the optional final policy. You got your expected grade four days prior to the exam, and you have to make an instant decision whether to take the exam or not (and study for it). It just adds too much burden to students. Plus it is extremely unfair for students who already have travel plans.He should go teaching electrical engineering since he can&#39;t stop talking about it. This class made my worst cornell experience so far. Didn&#39;t really learn anything from those time-consuming cases and superficial lectures which he tried to make them seem deep.Terrible, really terrible. Basically you learn nothing. And he TAKES ATTENDANCE, 2 points, 1 for attendance and another for paying attention. Your grade on this class, to a great extent, depends on what kinda TA you are assigned to. So basically, your luck counts a lot if you want to get a good grade.Prof. Perez enjoys what he lectures and tries to make seemingly-superficial material relevant. The course was somewhat disorganized, but Perez was very accommodating. As long as you do all the work, the class should be fine.Great teacher. We had to write a lot, but you get used to it.This is not a good class. He has a tendency to spontaneously freak out. He puts crap on the exams that came from nowhere. He just copies the book onto powerpoints and reads them to the class. I thought I would like this class and was very wrong.

Material itself was somewhat easy, even though I never took a statistics course in my life.  I was able to get a good grade without being a super-intelligent person. hahaEven though the class was easy, I still felt like I learned a good deal--not like I was wasting my time.

If you put in the effort (going to office hours, properly doing the HW) you will definitely end up with a good grade. Don&#39;t bother purchasing the textbook, just go take pictures of the HW questions from the library or the OH room.Cindy is a great stats instructor, but she needs serious help choosing her TAs. As other students already wrote, TAs did not know much and were even rude at times. They seemed to have been chosen randomly since their stats knowledge was shockingly deficient.Cindy is one of the kindest and silliest professors I&#39;ve had. She comes in with a great attitude every day and does not let anything get in her way of having a good day. Some of the material is hard to grasp, but there are so many resources available to you so that you can understand and succeed. Also she is good about giving points back on exams!Cindy is an amazing person and teacher. She uses humor and her lively personality in order to keep students&#39; attention in lectures of otherwise dry stuff. All of the class material is in the lecture packet, and the book is literally only used for a few homework problems. The class isn&#39;t a breeze but one could get a good grade with some effort.I couldn&#39;t have taken stats with any other prof. I am NOT a math person but her personality, explanation, and section layouts really help. It&#39;s a lot of work, but not more than any other 4 credit class. The homeworks are long but it really makes sure you understand, since there&#39;s a lot of material to be covered. Textbook&#39;s not necessary but helpfulI believe she is the best professor at Cornell! She is the rare combination of interested in her students, kind, intelligent, and great at communicating concepts. I wasn&#39;t very interested in taking statistics but because of Professor Van Es, it quickly became my favorite course. If you study and do homework you will get a good grade. Take it!Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!SO great!! I dont even like stat that much but she&#39;s awesomeNo discussion section when you can barely do well in the class without one. Everyone I know was struggling and if you don&#39;t understand, it&#39;s always your fault even if there are virtually no resources. There are TA&#39;s, but they move their office hours every single week so it&#39;s inconsistent. Take this class or this teacher if you want a headache.Wonderful professor! She&#39;s funny and goofy but that livened things up in class. Her &#34;brain breaks&#34; in the middle of lectures were also a lot of fun. I didn&#39;t do great on the first prelim (nobody really did) but if you go to her office hours (or the TAs) you&#39;ll do just fine. They&#39;re all so helpful and they really want you to succeed.You will have weekly sections and discussions in this class. My TA and section saved my grade. I found her lectures hard to follow but I also normally struggle in large lectures. She randomly takes attendance so if you happen to miss a day she takes attendance it really sucks. There is almost always office hours since there are so many TAs.Probably the goofiest, nicest, &amp; most likable professor I&#39;ve had. It&#39;s difficult to learn the material as she teaches it, but the course is arranged so that you&#39;re able to master it before the exams. Lectures got a bit monotonous near the end of the semester, but her personality is always refreshing. Her course packet is insanely helpful. AWESOME!!Loved her class. Didn&#39;t do so well on her first prelim, but I would recommend going to office hours and her office hours and you should be set for the course. Not hard material, she is very good about explaining it all, and if you check your homeworks in office hours, I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s not possible to get an A+.Lots of structure, lots of redundant work. Its a tough course but you learn a lot. Jack has little patience, but hes a nice guy and wants you to do well. There are some minor issues with materials, but far less than in past years it would seem. This is dependent on TAs. Sections are boring but good for learning.Curriculum materials are not updated to work with the new edition of the textbook.  Lectures are dry and boring. Textbook is also very expensive. I eventually switched to Hotel School&#39;s course, which turned out to be better. You will get more attention from teaching assistants in Hotel.Cindy is the best professor I have ever had at Cornell thus far! Lecture is so much fun and you learn quality material! If you hold up your end by attending lecture, paying attention and doing the hw and section work, she will help you get an A!I oved Professor Haeger&#39;s class and as an instructor, she did a good job. What I vehemently disliked was the disrespect towards students. I had her for an early class period, so students often would arrive a little late. Each time she would stop the whole class to essentially berate the student in front of their peers. It was absolutely unnecessaryAwesome lecturer. Tests are easy if you are willing to do the required work.Professor van Es is an excellent lecturer for intro stats. Her class is clearly organized and follows a note packet she has compiled. The discussion sections for the class are mandatory and help supplement and reinforce the material learned in class. While exams can be challenging, ample preparation can help you excel in this class.She was a great a helpful professor. Lectures aren&#39;t mandatory and you can still perform well in the class without attending lectures. The discussions were the most useful part of the class so take those seriously.Without a doubt the best professor I have had to date at Cornell. Clear and precise, fair tests and workloads.she&#39;s a hard teacher and the class is massive. her TAs were bad and there were definite favorites in the class. they didn&#39;t explain anything\/weren&#39;t helpful at all. i really wish i had take ilr stats in hindsight. only plus was that i managed to sell my textbook for a decent amount $Good professor although she seriously needs to learn how to create better support systems for students. Throughout the semester, my TA didn&#39;t seem to understand the material and could barely explain it. Going to office hours was useless.Prof. Van Es has been one of my best professors at Cornell. Her class really isn&#39;t harder than the other Stat classes if you keep up the work - which is very manageable. She truly wants you to succeed, and there are so many opportunities to get help. Could not have asked for a better Stat teacher.Nice prof. Cracks me up sometimes.  Class stinks though. It&#39;s stats how fun can you make it?Go to lecture because 1) it&#39;s easy to understand and 2) she gives out random participation points. Also go to section because what you don&#39;t understand in lecture, you will get in section and it&#39;s free points. Also buy the course packet because it&#39;s all the notes you&#39;ll need.Cool profThe textbook is such a waste of money. She gives you a 200 page course packet, and you very rarely use the textbook. Hilarious lecturer (in stats? yeah!), hot undergrad TAs, homeworks and sections were very helpful. Overall a well-organized and effective class.Cindy rules!  She is an excellent profesora, probably one of the best I&#39;ve had at Cornell thus far.  Although she does a great job and makes the material approachable and easy to understand, the prelims are not easy and you have to study a lot to do well.Cindy is a dynamic lecturer and a great person. She cares about her students doing well and will ensure everyone has the opportunity to succeed. Sections are super helpful. Cindy made stats enjoyable and if you study, you are guaranteed to get A&#39;s.The sections, homework and lectures all reinforced concepts that we needed to know, and the exams were very fair and based on these assignments. Participation is recommended because a % of your grade is derived from your participation in random in-class activities. The sections are helpful, but the lectures are made extremely amusing by Cindy.","difficulty":2.875,"rating":4.1875},{"index":239,"prof_name":"Robert Karpman","prof_dept":"Business","class_name":"AEM2120","comment":"Intelligent professor, but quite organized.

You can learn a lot from him if you are genuinely there to learn and not for the grade, he seems to know everything about anything you ask about-take time to get to know him if you canI turned in a 30 page project on one day, and they graded and returned it on the next.  There is no way they read every student&#39;s project and returned them in one day.  (the grades werent stellar, either). enough said.Great lecturer, very interesting and clear. Gets the point across really well. Class recommended as an enjoyable introduction to business. Lots of room for grade improvement.I thought this class was extremely pointless.  But, he allowed us to improve our grades and had a lot of extra credit opportunities.  I personally did not enjoy his teaching style, and he has an accent, which makes it a little harder to understand him.Perez is like the Venezualan father a WASP like me never had!  He&#39;s the nicest guy, the most dynamic lecturer.  He&#39;s one of the few profs that teaches a class of 400 kids and gets more than 3\/4 to come to every lecture.  TAKE HIS CLASS!Great class. Very enthusiastic professor.  Teaches well, very real world material.  Gives various opportunties to make you do well.  Take this class.pedro! pedro!  he&#39;s great, he remembers people&#39;s names, and helps you get internships, and he&#39;s just an awesome guy.  highly recommended pedro!This class should be renamed Common Sense 220.  Frankly, I found the material pretty boring, but Pedro is entertaining and a nice guy.  The one thing that bothered me is he never responded to my emails, so I dock him on helpfulness.This class is very easy.  The material is very easy to learn, and Pedro sounds like Desi Arnaz.  You can&#39;t get much better than that.This class is a waste of time. Easy A, but a terrible professor and terrible curriculum. Every lecture you go to makes you dumber and dumber. Do not take it unless you have to - and if you do take it, don&#39;t go to lecture as much as possible.the material is easyNo CommentsI agree with the person below me, this class is not too hard. I took this class as an elective, and I can say that it&#39;s very easy to get at least an A, and Pedro isn&#39;t all too bad. All the complaints you see are probably coming from dumb AEM majors who do zero work, so disregard them.No CommentsPedro&#39;s lectures are just taken straight from the textbook, and would be pointless if he didnt have the mandatory attendance with the clickers. his prelims arent that bad, but you have to memorize a lot of useless info.class is incredibly disorganized.  tests are tricky and confusing.  lectures are boring.I&#39;ve had four classes with this guy already and more than sick of it. The first two were a mistake and the second two were required. If you can avoid him, I suggest you do sothe most disorganized class i have taken . i took the class for fun, to learn business. i havent learnt a thing. he squeezes in too much information in one lecture. he is a relaly nice guy , and i hate to say anything negative, but he should have GRAD TA&#39;s in his class. undergrads dont know how to run the class. and HIS OPINION answers are only ritNot a very good professor at all, his choice of undergrad TAs were very bad. He never responds to emails in a timely fashion, the secretary for the class is not friendly, and the way they graded our huge projects is insulting. Overall, one of the worse professors I have had at CU. Very nice man but as a Cornell prof, I hope he doesn&#39;t get tenure.worst teacher ever. period.Overall class is good for those who don&#39;t have much background in business.  Tests weren&#39;t bad but felt somewhat unreasonably tricky on some parts.Don&#39;t take this useless course unless you absolutely have to for a prereq.. you will learn nothing useful.  He&#39;s a nice guy but he can&#39;t teach and his tests are incredibly unfair ( as in the questions make no sense and the answers are all opinion).  The class is an embarrasment to Cornell.This is one of those classes where you can ship it on a regular basis and still earn a good grade. Or attend it a study for something else.Interesting professor, entertaining.  Lots of extra credit!!!!!!!!!!No CommentsVery easy course, entertaining leactures, and an over all great professor. There&#39;s no stress here.What a freakin pointless class.  Cornell is so retarded for making us take this class!Take this class if you don&#39;t want to learn anything, but want an easy A\/A+.People say that his tests are not common sense, because they&#39;re not;to ace his tests,you need to study his notes and know his (often supremely illogical) opinions and viewpoints on things.Answer questions on the exams based on what he said in lecture, not based on logic.Easily the worst professor I have had.  He is an embarrassment to Cornell.Horrendous teacher. Lectures are boring, and he just reads off his poorly made powerpoints. Has no idea how to design a test. Group project takes a  lot of time, but was the only useful experience I got out of the class.  Perez is an arrogant, arbitrary, thinks he knows it all, short little boy who knows NOTHING. Got an A+ in the class though.Nice guy! In addition, an embarassment to education, let alone an Ivy League education. I wouldn&#39;t let this guy teach fourth grade for fear that the students my develop a habit for drawing pictures on standardized test bubble sheets. If you are are really good at guessing, take this course. If not just watch CNBC for an hour or two.Pedro&#39;s inability to teach is only matched by his personal lack of success in the business field. He will shout very loudly and wave his arms, but then words either do not make sense or are blatantly incorrect. You will do well just memorize the textbook. However, there are bucket loads of extra credits. Tests are irrelevant and largely arbitrary.Really interesting class! I had a hard time with the accent at first cuz I am not used to it but after a while, I got used to it. He is very lively, passionate and good. I loved this class.Pedro is not really as bad as everyone makes him out to be.  He tests the material in ways you haven&#39;t seen before which can be confusing but there is enough extra credit where, if you put the time in, you can easily get an A. Because the class is so large, if you want help you need to ask for it. But if you ask for it, he&#39;s a pretty caring guy.Nothing&#39;s better than the AEM department for an easy A!Tests are unclear, material is boring.  The only good parts were the guest lecturers and the extra credit opportunities.Everyone complains about Professor Perez, but in reality, the class is 100% memorization.  Getting in the A range is easy if you just memorize all of the random lists on the powerpoint slides (flashcards are a life saver).  Even if you don&#39;t like this class and you are not doing well, you will be in love with Professor Perez and his mannerismsProfessor Perez covers the material really well. a whole lot of useful information, and people who kept telling me it was common sense ended up getting a grade in the 70s on the exam. the exams were really are tough. all of the extra credit and doing well on the final earned me an A+. and many people got As with the extra credit.Sigh.... what a waste of my time and money. Complete arbitrary lists on test. One of his colleagues said this class was poorly taught and low and behold, it definitely is. Some of his TA&#39;s are cool, but some suck, esp J. cancion. She must have chronic TOXIC PMS. There is extra credit &amp; lowest test grade dropped if u do op.project. But again...sigh.Given the material the course covers, he does an OK job teaching AEM 220.  But his tests are not very balanced, and your grade is based only on the three tests.  Best to avoid this class if you can.The tests are VERY subjective. The person who said you can have a textbook and still be 70% unsure about the test is SO HONEST. The TAs are really incompetent and do nothing except stand around during lecture. There is extra credit but who wants to run around doing extra credit. The course sucks.First off, the person two or three bellow said the average grade was in the 60s - that&#39;s not true, his average grades are around 80 on each exam. The exams reflect business situations, which if you haven&#39;t prepared for hte exam, you won&#39;t understand. He&#39;s a great professor, willing to help his students, and he learns people&#39;s names! Love the Class!Prof Perez is a great guy!  His tests could get into specific details sometimes, but if you got in the 80&#39;s on them, you could still get an A in the class based on extra credit and the project.  He&#39;s awesome if you ever get to interact with him- definitely make use of the opportunities (like the guest lecture luncheons).  I def recommend the class.Hey, what&#39;s with all of the Pedro-bashing out there?  This guy is enthusiastic, energetic, and most importantly, he likes working w\/ students.  Itook this class b\/c nothing else fit into my schedule, but I loved it. You do have to work for your grade, but there are lots of opportunities for extra credit.  Put simply, you get out what you put in.","difficulty":2.4318181818,"rating":2.75},{"index":241,"prof_name":"Pedro Perez","prof_dept":"Business","class_name":"AEM2200","comment":"If you are not a hard worker, you will not perform well in the course. There are a ton of cases, and they actually are pretty intellectually challenging. Perez himself is incredibly smart, but you really have to attentively listen to him to understand the depth of his lectures. I highly recommend participating as much as you can in this course.The weekly cases (sometimes 2 or 3 a week) can make the class seem so long. Study the previous lecture for the quizzes. Lecture heavy. The final group presentation project isnt bad, just have to have an understanding of the case. Not a bad class overall, can be on your laptop.Mostly, the class is not too hard if you do the work. The material of quizes at times is not what is assigned, but reading the chapter reviews is very helpful. FInal project grades are usually universally very low which brings everyone&#39;s grades down.The majority of my work that semester was from his class (case studies and 2 large projects). The quizzes were literally impossible, and reading the chapters they were supposedly based on didn&#39;t help. However I  managed to get an A in the class so looking back I&#39;m okay with it. Take advantage of all extra credit and try to participate in class.You do not really learn that much in lecture, and the quizzes in class can be tough, but overall everyone does well and it is a great first business class at the Dyson School.Pedro is a a below average professor. His lectures are incoherent, and the class provides you with such minimal information about different areas of business that I left each class without having learned much. His teaching assistants grade unfairly at times and are not the nicest people. I was not impressed or happy with this class or professor.Smart guy but very unclear in what he expects for assignments. At the end of the semester, he even refused to tell you your overall score, such as participation grade. Even though he taught nothing in class, he is a very tough grader, and cares nothing about the students&#39; feeling. This is the worst experience that I have ever had in Cornell. Cornell really should find another prof.One legit question on a quiz he gave us is &#34;Is quality expensive?&#34; (Answer was somehow &#39;false&#39;) Studying for the many tests is almost useless since he will ask the most arbitrary irrelevant questions just to make sure no one gets 100. He&#39;s pretty passionate\/animated about his subject, but it gets in the way of letting the lectures be clear.Disorganized &amp; a lack of communication. Expect to complete around two case studies per week as well as some unrelated modules without any feedback (all case studies I completed September-November were not graded until the end of December). Large final group project. I recommend you befriend your TA because they are the people who grade everything.He is extremely passionate about his subject.  His quizzes are fairly difficult, especially if you don&#39;t read the textbook.  Also, TA grading can be fairly subjective.  I highly recommend going to TA office hours to talk about cases.  Overall a great and informative class!  Pedro knows a lot and is willing to share if you speak with him.Oh Pedro. Great guy, clearly very smart and caring, but this class is a bit of a mess. You&#39;ll never get grades back, and there are a LOT of case studies. Lot of work with little feedback, little knowledge on how to improve your work, really only learned about how to write up a case. Perez really cares about his students though a bit scatterbrained.Perez is nice, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable. That being said, the class is terrible. Lectures were basically pointless if you did not have to present a case and there were roughly 2 cases due every week. There were also many pointless modules and grades were not given back until months after the assignment was submitted.Can&#39;t stand himThe quizzes were, at times, very arbitrary. Perez lacks organization in his lectures at times. The TA grading is subjective and Perez often has mood swings. He is a nice guy though; he will answer questions after class. This class requires a significant time commitment. Make sure to spend a lot of time on the final project.Get an easier TA! Quizzes are often a surprise, mostly based off of power points, that at times doesn&#39;t make complete sense.

The lecture notes and textbook are really helpful.Took this class because I thought it would be good to get a little background in finance. I wish I could have given easiness a 10. Little is a joke, I can&#39;t believe he is teaching such an important class. If you want a real prof take FA in engineering or something. Got 95+ on all the tests, and I am no genius (ILR). Went only to the first lecture.Little is a very nice guy. However, this class was still, to date, the worst experience of my Cornell career. His tests are very difficult and tricky, although he grades fairly. He is willing to help you out if you meet him, but it doesn&#39;t help so much in the end. You either know this stuff from the first day or you do not. If you don&#39;t, drop quickProfessor Little is the man! He is the most organizaed professor ever and he knows his stuff. He is a little dry during lecture but only because accounting in general isn&#39;t the most exciting topic. Talk to him out of class and you&#39;ll think he&#39;s a riot.Jack&#39;s a really nice guy.  He seems to not have any clue how to curve, as the grade distribution last semester can only be described as an &#34;inverted normal curve.&#34;  But, that means he gives lots of really high grades...Lectures are boring, homework is sort of tedious, but exams are fair.Classes are boring, so make sure you stay awake!  Tests weren&#39;t too easy, but if you do better on the final than one of the prelims, he lets you count it twice.Study hard- his tests are pretty tricky.  The first prelim isn&#39;t bad at all, but the exams after that get progressively harder.  I heard he was easy before, but changed the tests because too many people got As. He&#39;s got a wonky sense of humor so it makes lectures on such a dry topic a bit more fun.Class is very boring. HW is very time consuming but you should definately do it yourself (don&#39;t copy and don&#39;t use the textbook answers which half the class will somehow obtain a week into class) Doing the HWs is the only way you can learn this. Lecture and sections are boring, but you have to go. Attendence in section that is 15% and quizes in lecNice sense of humor...for an accountant. An overall easy class.easy class... no need to go to lecture other than for viewpoints. homeworks are boring and annoying, as are sections. tests can have tricky multiple choice, but the written part is a jokeGreat teacher!

Class depends on doing and understanding the homework. Nice guySuch an easy class. No need to attend lecture, just read the book and learn the material from there. The Prelims are pretty easy once you understand the homework.Easy class overall but, more often than not, the homework\/section\/demo problems would contain significant errors. Often, after spending hours trying to get the hw problems to work out, I would come to section and find out that we were given the wrong numbers. This was nearly every week. VERY frustrating when trying to do homework or study for testsCourse packet was very useful. Section problems really cemented the subject. He teaches a relatively easy subject well. Textbook helped a bit though not necessary. A straight forward class and professor. Exams held few surprises. Section attendance on-time requirement was my only disliked part of the course.Little expects his students to read the book before his lectures. People who don&#39;t adapt to this early may have problems later in the course since most of the material is based on a few fundamental concepts. Lecture isn&#39;t necessary, but it&#39;s nice for clarifying little nuances. Most of your learning will come from doing the actual accounting.I absolutely loved this class. I got an A by paying attention in class and doing the homework. Prelims are fair and not very challenging. Highly recommend.I really liked Jack as a professor- he&#39;s very no-nonsense and wants you to learn accounting. He gives you tons of practice problems- do them all and there shouldn&#39;t be any surprises on the exams. The sections are helpful if you have good TAs, homework doesn&#39;t take too long, overall a really good class.Homework\/Section\/Demo materials include errors. Sections are mandatory and excessively long. There are lots of duplicates - online homework, online quizzes, and paper-and-pencil homework. It is an overkill to do all three.  A lot of materials towards the end of course are actually intermediate level, so it is unnecessarily advanced.If you don&#39;t like accounting, then you&#39;ll find this class boring as I did.  The textbook was my lifesaver since I personally found lecture to be tedious.  The prelims are fair but the final was harder than expected.  Don&#39;t fall behind in this class and you&#39;ll do fine.Great professor, clear, fair, and direct. Good lecturer and honestly interested in helping you learn the material.Given the fact that this was an accounting class (very dry material), Prof did a great job making it interesting. Very personable and good lecturer, the entire course is designed to teach you accounting by doing it, very well structured in my opinion. Great professor.Professor Lewis (was in ithaca college before Cornell) is great. Very good with following up with emails and very reasonable. Provides you a lot of resources and happy to answer any of our questions. Would recommend taking his class. But not an easy A, you have to earn it. The workload is average.Little is awesome. He really cares about his students and he does an excellent job explaining concepts.Not an easy class, but was my favorite. Learned very little from lecture -read and highlight the book, study from the book then do practice tests and HW, you should get an A.\n Little is not very student friendly, but the TAs are great! As long as you read a Chapter a week and study before the exam you&#39;ll get an A.\n Don&#39;t be afraid to take this clasThe class was really boring, but Professor Little was such a great guy and offered so many resources that really helped me get through the semester. Super helpful in office hours. If you have to take Accounting, take it with him.Really does not know the materials.

Great material and I feel 10000% more prepared for my internship in finance this summer. Hat off to you, Rich Curtis!!!!!!!!Tough class, large amount of material and exams are challenging. Multiple choice but trickyreally have to know it wording. Curtis is very thorough and clear in lecture, but they are long (esp the 2hr &#34;discussion&#34;) and his course packet is similarly comprehensive. Snippy and strict  discourages participation, but very nice when you approach him.One of most adorable professors I haver had at Cornell. Really clear, caring, and sweet in a fairly unique way. Exams are fair and manageable. Just one thing. a 115-minute session is really too long and sometimes it gets really hard to stay awake no matter how interesting the lecture is.A great professor, super accessible and a wonderful guy. He is extremely helpful and wants you to succeed in his class. Would really recommend!Curtis is by far and without any question the best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell so far. His class is far from easy, but his assessments are fair given his excellent pedagogical merit. Because of him, Finance is an extremely engaging course.Prof. Hwang is there best in the business. Whether your into Fi or not, you will need to thoroughly understand the fundamentals of equities and fixed income if your going to be big in this game. Hwang is a world class Corporate Finance prof, and renown researcher in Behavioral-Fi. World class prof, in a world class program. Sit up front.I took his class in 2012 and honestly, he made me pay attention and learn a lot. But... wow, what an unnecessarily unpleasant man. I&#39;ve had plenty of other teachers that did not need to resort to oppressive tactics to make their students learn effectively.Terrible professor. Would never take a class with him if had a choice. Take Finance somewhere else. Totally doesn&#39;t worth your time. I&#39;m usually an A+ student, and got a B in his class. Not recommended at all.Great professor with an innate ability to translate complicated finance concepts into simple, easy-to-understand ideas. Can be very strict in giving instructions and very tough on students, but he does it because he cares so much about his students. He takes the time to get to know every student and truly wants to best for everyone.","difficulty":3.5333333333,"rating":4.2666666667},{"index":254,"prof_name":"Richard Curtis","prof_dept":"Business","class_name":"AEM2241","comment":"One of the worst classes in AEM, if not at Cornell.Very disrespectful to student&#39;s and TA&#39;s. Avoid at all costs.Strict professor and very disorganized lecturesThis class was an absolute waste of time. Disorganized lectures, little guidance, and a moody professor. Take the finance course offered by the hotel school.If you think the 40-paged syllabus is excessive, you&#39;re going to think this entire course is excessive.Do not take this class if you have any interest in learning about finance.Go to his review lectures, they will save you hours of cumbersome lectures throughout the semester. But if you really want to save some valuable time, take a different finance class.His lectures are some of the most sleep inducing ordeals I have had to deal with at Cornell and he makes it worse by shaming you if you&#39;re not attentive. Considering that I only have this issue with this class, I wonder whose fault this really is.Oh my god this class was so much busy work. If her presented the material in a more organized fashion, all the concepts would have come across better with less self teaching required. Exams super simple if you keep up with readings, which is essentially the entire class.He knows magic tricks. His most famous trip is making the class fall asleep.The ridiculous course packet, the ridiculous videos, ridiculous exams, the ridiculous lectures, and his ridiculous attitude make this a ridiculous class.An OK teacher that seems to care about his lectures, but it seems to be more about the way he displays himself rather actual care for students. Very unapproachable.This was by far the worst course in the Dyson minor. Anyone interesting in learning about finance should avoid this class.If you&#39;re shopping for finance classes to take for the business minor, I would not recommend this class. It&#39;s a lot of busy work and the professor is not very helpful or clear in lectures.I cannot fathom why anyone would willingly subject themselves to this course willingly.It&#39;s impressive how this man managed to turn a course about finance into a course about him.Unfair grading, exam, and lecture policies make this course extremely inconvenient. Lectures in a disorganized and unprepared fashion, worrying more about who he can get in trouble rather than the dissemination of knowledge. I probably learned more about course logistics from this class than I did finance. I would not recommend him or his class.A terrible professor who is more interested in touting his ego than teaching finance.His lectures and his course packet were useless and his attitude was disgusting. Worst professor ever.Prof Curtis shows a disrespect towards students which makes this course a terrible experience. I recommend taking any other finance course available, he&#39;s really not helpful.Terrible professorI learned more from spending 2 hours skimming the textbook than I did from all of his lectures or the course packet. By the way, don&#39;t by the review manual, it is not helpful at all when studying for the exams.This was the worst class I have ever taken.This was one of the most disorganized courses I&#39;ve ever been in. Professor Curtis acts as if his lectures are meticulously crafted, but he is clearly always winging it based on his complete inability to elaborate concepts to a lecture. Whenever he feels he is losing steam, he takes his frustration out on his students.Rich Curtis is the definition of a power trip. So mean!This class is awful. Avoid!Professor Curtis makes you pay $35 for a bunch of sheets of paper required for his class that he refuses to distribute electronically because it would damage his ego to see students with laptops in his lectures. Save yourself some money and take finance with a more level-headed professor.I don&#39;t know what this course gave me that purchasing the textbook would not have given me.took AEM 2241 and while definitely among the most difficult courses I&#39;ve ever taken, Curtis is by far the BEST professor I&#39;ve ever had. His lectures might be long and he might seem mean (esp if you have your phone out in lecture), but I learned so much. Curtis also gives candy during exams. Study the course packet and textbook.go to the review sessions, Curtis re-do all of it. the longest I&#39;ve been to was 7 hrs, from 7pm to 2am. That&#39;s dedicationProfessor Curtis is the only professor who refuses to take student questions during lectures. Let that sink in.Terrible class, Curtis emphasizes memorization over concepts...This course taught me that there is more to life than high finance.super rude and agressive even though it was through an email.. after I told him I dropped, he suddenly became nice....Curtis is an OK teacher and goes all out in OH if he likes you. The problem is that he&#39;s extremely terrifying and vindictive in lectures, not hesitating to stop it to scream at somebody for having a water bottle in the auditorium. I got a good grade, but it felt like an abusive spouse - mean enough to scare, but nice enough that you won&#39;t leave.Put in the work and you will do well. Curtis is a great professor when you get to know him and his teaching style. If youre willing to work hard and seek out help if youre struggling, Curtis will help you succeed; no other professor holds extra office hours late into the night (around midnight) the week before the exam. Highly recommendCurtis is not a very pleasant guy and is very particular, but he puts a lot of effort into preparing his material and teaching finance. He says attendance is mandatory but it clearly is not. Whole grade based on 4 tests. His tests aren&#39;t easy, but seemed to become a lot easier once class went online. At least there&#39;s never any work besides studyingThis class was maddeningly tediousHe is literally the worst professor I have had in four years. He doesn&#39;t know how to lecture and purely emphasizes memorization of all concepts. He picks random and unrelated topics from the textbook and tests you on it. His teaching style is incompatible with any student&#39;s learning. Take hotelie finance, it is significantly easier. ABORTClass is tough, but you can learn a lot from it. Professor has strict rules, but if you talk to him, his personality is very very nice! If you want to learn well in Finance, recommend this class. But if you&#39;re doing it just for fun or interest, consider the one in hotel school. Overall, I like this class very much. Almost cry in the last class lolI learned everything from his 600 page &#34;supplemental&#34; course packet and that forsakenly dry textbook, but his pride will ensure you get no higher than a B- if you skip lecture bc of 5-6 questions on his exam that you could only have gotten if you epoxied your eyelids open during his vegetative-state inducing lectures.BAD CLASS BAD PROFIf u need to take this class for a requirement, do it now while it&#39;s online. He&#39;s super knowledgeable, genuinely caring, &amp; is pretty engaging considering finance is dry af, but is VERY strict during in-person lectures. No phones\/no coming a second late (which is difficult bc the class is @ the dairy bar). exams aren&#39;t bad, pay attention to lecturesDisgusting attitude. Makes fun of kids who can&#39;t answer questions correctly, even when they make an honest effort. Doesn&#39;t remotely care about those who are struggling in class, blames it on you not making an effortIf you&#39;re doing the business minor, take this over Hotel finance - we covered the whole textbook but Hotel only goes up to around ch. 12. You will not believe this on the first day but he is an amazing professor. I think he acts unapproachable in the beginning so people take him seriously, but he cares a lot about teaching and you&#39;ll learn so muchProf Curtis is challenging and expects a lot from his students.  however, his class is worthwhile especially if you are thinking about going into finance. the class is time consuming but Prof Curtis is very clear with how he assigns work and provides helpful review sessions before exams. would recommend this course to someone interested in financeDo yourself a favor and take Hotelie finance over this class. Lectures are useless and tests don&#39;t evaluate knowledge of the material well. On top of that, the professor is menacing.This class was really easy but filled with constant belaboring about its difficulty. The language spoken by the professor is reminiscent of a frustrated high school teacher.If you&#39;re an engineer, you can probably get away with just showing up to his 4+ hour review sessions. The lectures are very long winded and uninteresting; I just wish I went to fewer of them at the beginning. Really poorly organized course.TAKE HOTELIE FINANCEFinance with Professor Curtis was probably my most unpleasant experience taking a course at Cornell. He is unreasonably strict to the point of distraction.I did not enjoy this class.Cornell&#39;s most disresptful professor.Would have been a better class if he wasn&#39;t so mean. Lectures always went overtime. Review sessions went on way longer than they should have. He said they shouldn&#39;t be substitution for lectures, but they essentially were lecture repeats. Stopped going to class after the first review session because I realized this and I missed nothing.By far Dyson&#39;s worst class...I put very little work in his class and got a good grade, but he was no help and incredibly rude to students in lecture.Stay far away from this class if youre interested in learning anything useful about finance.","difficulty":2.5789473684,"rating":1.5614035088},{"index":255,"prof_name":"David Lee","prof_dept":"Business","class_name":"AEM230","comment":"Excellent course.

Has high expectations of students and doesn&#39;t patronize.Could be a pretty difficult class.  The homeworks are easy and it definitely helps to go to discussion sections.

The class isn&#39;t too hard, partly because of the content, and also because it&#39;s AEM and all AEM classes are easy. As long as you go to lecture you&#39;ll be fine. Tests aren&#39;t too bad, but do have some specific facts here and there. Sadly no calculations are done on tests.Very good professor in an interesting class.  Not difficult to get an A if you put the work in, some of the material will be hard if economics and a little finance isn&#39;t your thing.I went in thinking this would be an easy A. Turns out Prof. Lee isn&#39;t the best lecturer and his slides could not be more vague or useless. Highly recommend not taking this course, unless you&#39;re ready to do heavy reading and learn the slides by heart. In addition to this his prelims means are low (78-80 range) and questions are terribly worded.Be prepared to memorize a lot. Lee is a good instructor, but his exams are based on very specific terms from both the book and his lectures. He definitely makes the class harder than it could be.DO NOT take this class. Prof seems so overqualified to teach this stuff that he almost seems more bored than the few ppl that still go to class. Terrible at explaining things, unstructured coursework, and uninteresting. A decent effort at studying for the tests result in a good grade, probably because of the massive curve. Still a waste of timeProfessor Lee is one of the best professors\/lecturers I&#39;ve had at Cornell. He&#39;s really passionate and it comes across in his lectures. Some topics are slow but he&#39;s engaging. You definitely have to go to class and listen to do well on the exams, but that&#39;s all it really takes. Standard grading structure and hw&#39;s are easy and count for a big chunknot a difficult class. never read textbook and did well on all prelims. go to lecture and memorize notes and will be fineHe&#39;s a good lecturer. However, he penalizes students who are good at analytical problems but not rote memorization by making exams almost entirely memorization based. So if you can analyze the effect of a trade policy analytically but don&#39;t remember trivial facts like how many jobs have been outsourced - tough luck, you&#39;re not going to do well.Worst professor ever. His class is so boring. He doesn&#39;t teach anything. The problem sets don&#39;t make any sense because he never does anything with his class. His tests are based off of obscure facts in his horrible powerpoints.

Only class where I actually wanted to go to class. :) I really enjoyed the guest speakers, the marketing derby, and the movie clips in class. :)  The exams are a little difficult though, so watch out for that...This class is not an easy A. Maybe I was just too lazy but I didn&#39;t end up doing very well. You definitely need to do the readings for the tests, and really know them well.  Lecture was fun some times, esp. when he dressed up in a Campbell&#39;s soup costume.Test should reinforce what is learned - not to see if you can READ THE PROFESSORS MIND! Terrible professor.STUDY FOR THE EXAMS.  I completely underestimated the difficulty of the prelims, but thankfully he let us drop a prelim so I still did really well (after some serious studying). Read the textbook, take really good notes, and pay attention to guest lectures and you&#39;ll do well.  Lectures are fun (movie clips and ads), but the book is boring as hellProf. McLaughlin was not very helpful in general, not very insightful, and quite frankly I question his aptitude and the fact that he runs the AEM program. The class was not too hard, sure the prelims were tricky, but with all the extra credit ANYONE should be able to get an A. Read the book, especially the extra articles in the chapters.This class sucks.  He teaches a very easy subject that only requires common sense, yet somehow his tests are impossible, requiring minute details.  This class is a waste of timeNot a bad teacher, but definitely an ass. He is the kind to punish you for skipping his class before a break. His tests are completely evil.my fav classVery interesting material and an amazing lecturer. But the tests, which make up 90% of your grade are very keen to details. They were much harder than I expected.the pro of a good lecture does NOT outweigh the con of good grades..def NOT recommend this class for anyone wanting to do well in a course. appears to be a nice guy but NOT. &#34;easy&#34; lectures, hard prelims, and whats w\/ completely random attendencvery interesting class...nice guy, very interested in marketing...tough prelims though...I would reccommend the classthe class is interesting, and the lectures are engaging, but the tests are horrendously hard. nothing you do will prepare you sufficiently for his nitpicky details....Very enjoyable class, but HARD tests.He&#39;s a great teacher! I loved the in-class commercials and guest lectures of very prominent business Cornell alum\/people. Tests are hard, prepare for them! Out of the 4 exams you take, the lowest one gets dropped. AWESOME! Good amount of EC offeredInteresting class, not a lot of work, but prelims are quite hard. Still, a good class that&#39;s worth takingTake this class! One of the better AEM classes - fun and interesting. The prelims are very tricky, but they&#39;re curved up. Very little work.Be sure to attend all his classes, he might cover some meterials outside the textbook.  Prior to Fall 2004, there are 3 out of 4 essay topic on each prilim.  At Fall 2004, only 1 out of 2 essay topic for each prelim. Pay more attention to the topic that he emphasizes in class repeatedly.Great guy, great class ... How funny was it when he fell off the stage? I loved it.One of the best classes I&#39;ve ever taken. Great prof - interesting lectures, gotta love the movie clips and ads during lecture. Prelims are much easier than in past years. If you do extra credit and study for prelims, you should get in the A range.Interesting subject and pleasant professor but the tests are horrible. He tests on the most insignifacnt details instead of important concepts, discouraging actual learning in lieu of factual memorization. Be sure to go to class and, read several times, and pay attention at guest lectures.Pretty easy, fun class. If you do the reading and study, and extra credit, you should end up in the A range. No outisde work other than studying for 3 prelims (don&#39;t have to take the final if you do well on them).ed mclaughlin is my hero.  he knows his marketing, especially about the food industry.  a brilliant guy who should write more books.Wow...who knew marketing could be so hard.  The degree of difficulty of the lectures does not equal the difficulty of the exams.  Nice guy, but there is soo much to know for tests.Really great lectures.  Tests are difficult, but overall the class is highly recommended.His lectures are decent and he does explain things in a easy-to-digest fashion. The tests, however, may be unexpected difficult and require you to recall tiny bits of useless information from text\/guest lectures. If you want the bonus credits, make your response as cheesy as possible. Just imagine you are trying to entertain your grandfather.A good class if you&#39;re interested in marketing. Not too much work, just read the textbook and take good notes. Tricky exams but do the extra credits and especially the marketing derby if you want an A.

Even if you aren&#39;t interested in his classes, I recommend you take one simply for the sake of spending a semester listening to his lectures. Ask questions about his research! A lot of it is really interesting. He is intelligent, well traveled, funny, and an all-around good guy.Tests are directly from problem sets. Lectures are about as unorganized as they come, and have nothing to do with the prelims. That being said, a very interesting guy. Lots of research and general worldly knowledge. Super nice and always has students&#39; best interests. Class is fun, typical Cornell kids hate it because it&#39;s out of the box. No book :)Nice guy, but his lectures are disorganized and mostly irrelevant to the problem sets &amp; tests. After everyone got an A- or above on the first exam, he put really weird, unclear questions on the second one so we wouldn&#39;t do well even if we knew the material. Can&#39;t prove equations or do arithmetic, and refuses to do any of the math in office hours.Awkward, cold and standoff-ishProfessor Blalock seems like a really genuinely nice and caring guy, but he really can&#39;t teach for his life. When I found out he graduated from Yale and TJ I couldn&#39;t believe it, because he could not do simple multiplication problems without getting himself confused. It&#39;s really a shame that he can&#39;t teach, super qualified guy. Go to lecture, pay attention, go to section, follow along the problems, do the problems sets. If you do all those plus a quick review (maybe 1-2 hours) before the exam you will do well. The exams are exactly like the problem sets.   Go to class, do the hw, be a good student for once and you&#39;ll do fine.Lectures are a little bit hard to follow since he talks quickly, but you don&#39;t *really* need to attend lecture (only on the days that problem sets are due or they&#39;re handing back assignments). The prelims are the same as the problem sets\/discussion questions, so make sure to study those. He seems kind of cold but he&#39;s not mean.He gives really great lectures that keep the materiel as interesting as possible. 2601 is far better than 2600. His tests are pretty easy and based heavily on problem sets and lectures. Content is very well presented and its easy to learn for the test. Outside of class he&#39;s a really interesting guy and I would recommend getting to know himTerry is not only a fantastic and knowledgeable professor, he is a great person. No matter the difficulty you&#39;re having reach out and he&#39;ll be there to help. Tests are fairly written, yet cover a lot of content so you cant bs your way through the class. Again, terry is the brotha, love this dudeOne of the best human beings I have ever met. He was so charismatic, and cares about each of his students. Made concepts very clear, and was really patient with re-explanations, reviews, and introducing material.

You will become an expert in finance. You should definitely take this course. Go to class, pay attention and take good notes - don&#39;t read textbook - and its not hard since he teaches it so well. My grade was curved from an A- to an A and I skipped a prelim.I took this finance class in the summer of 2006.  In hindsight, it was a great learning experience: Mr. Curtis was meticulous in his lectures, and students truly immersed themselves in the interactive classroom experience.  That said, I believe the lecturer could have been less intimidating. One doesn&#39;t need to intimidate in order to inspire.I dont know what all this talk is about the class being easy it is by far the hardest class required in the AEM major, I guess say what you will about AEM. With that said, if you do enough work, this class is manageable for almost anyone. Curtis is a great professor, he is unbelievably passionate about finance, great guy too. One of my best classesProfessor Curtis is the best professor I&#39;ve had over 8 years of academia. He inspired me to follow a career in Finance and now in teaching. There is no one like him. His classes were difficult but enjoyable. He set high expectations and helped you reach them. He knew all of his students by name because he cares for each student.Best finance class ever!best business class... he&#39;s a great teacher and makes the material really easy to understandCurtis is da man!  He is a magician!If you tend to fall asleep in class don&#39;t take finance with him....there is no place in the whole auditorium he does not walk though. you can sneeze all the way across the room and he will say bless you..meaning..he is always watching you..but he is smartThis man is brilliant!  He memorizes every students name out of a 250 person lecture.Best Prof. I have ever had. The most interesting course I have ever taken. It&#39;s a pretty tough course overall.A great teacher, but God help you if you fall asleep in lecture or your cell phone goes off.  He will eat you alive.I have never learned so much important information before!  It is a hard class, but if you want to consider yourself a smart person, take it with curtis.Hard class, but he&#39;s a real good professor.  He&#39;s also helpful.VERY impressive memory, knows every single student in a pool of hundreds. very clear lectures. a very good class to takehe&#39;s a great guy, but finance is a miserable class.  he didn&#39;t make it any less interesting, but he tried hard to be funny.  very hard.  never fall asleep or let your phone ring in that class, and do well or he hunts you down with at least 2 ta&#39;s by his side to force you to get help.  but a nice guyGood class but he treats everyone there like high school students. Or maybe it&#39;s just the studentsHe knows his stuff.  He is very helpful and up to date on the market.Insanely smart lecturer. It was one of the best courses i&#39;ve ever taken at cornell. Definitely up there with gov 181 with katzenstein. You can tell he really enjoys subject matter and communicates it effectively. Great prof overall!He is definitely one of the few prof I will miss a lot.  His class is not terrible as long as you don&#39;t study at the last min.  Great Lecturer.  A nice and hardworking prof who cares about students a lot.  My friends say he replies students&#39; e-mails AT 3:00AM.   Can&#39;t really ask for more from a teacher.  Highly recommended for all students.He is incredibly intelligent and an unbelievable lecturer. If you pay attention in class, then you will leave every lecture with a surprising comprehension of complex ideas. You definitely get the bang for your buck with this class. As a senior, he is the best professor I have had at Cornell yet! He may be scary, but you can&#39;t help not love himA great professor,probably my favorite at Cornell.The class is a challenge, but he cares about every single one of his students and is really rooting for everyone to do well.At the beginning he tries to intimidate you but as long as you study you&#39;ll be fine.By the end you will love him and be happy you took the class. I will definetely miss him!Very good teacher. Wants all his students to do well. He tries to intimidate you at first, but all you need to do is go to section and lecture. Read all the assignments and buy the course packet. Great guy once you get to know him and really knows his stuff.Very thorough teacher.  He makes all the notes, teaches the sections.  Very clear, and can sometimes seem scary, but great guy.  Course is tough, but he prepares you very well for exams.  In the end its a great course.  Dont talk in class, and don&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever get out of section early, even if the pink pages are finished.Quizzes everyday, but good class!Great professor\/great class.The best professor I have had at Cornell. Tests are tough but if you study and read the text book no reason you cant do well. Always available to talk or answer questions (even though he gets back to you at 3 or 4 AM).

Sometimes if you see him in the hallway and he&#39;d look like he doesn&#39;t want to talk to you, but he&#39;s actually helpful and nice if you approach him with questions.  His classes are tough -no questions about that.  The problem sets take a long time to do, but everyone should get a decent grade if you put enough effort into it.He knows the material very very well and can explain anything. Extremely helpful - whenever problem sets are due he will walk into u-grad lounge where people are working on them and ask if anyone is stuck or needs help. Will spend as much time as you need with you personally to help you understand it. Best Professor at Cornell.As a instructor, Kusse does not present any material not mentioned in the text book he wrote.  He is very helpful and clear and knows the material very well.  Also very funny and witty; some students may not like his sarcasm, but I always find it funny.  First professor in Cornell who actually seems like a teacher and not just a lecturer.yea, he will eat ppl who ask questions.Possibly one of the best teachers at Cornell.  He is very good at helping students out when they don&#39;t understand something.pretty rough, attacks anyone who asks questions. not ethusiastic in teaching, mistakes often.Difficult course, but he did a pretty good job teaching it.

He, unlike most professors, shows his respect for you as an intellectual.  He is definitely well-liked by most students.  Also, his book is very clear.  Tied with Tomas Arias as best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell.haha, what can you say? he wrote the book on mathematical physics. no, really, he did. his lectures are good, but homework takes like 3 hours per problem.

Her lecture slides are densely compacted with useless jargon. The textbook is a little elementary, but then again so is she. I don&#39;t know how this lady still has a job. She is nice though, I suppose.Her lectures are a mess, her homework is often 5-6 pages long where each question is 5-8 parts and each part is a long rant that goes nowhere. One of the only professors who can take an easy concept and make it completely incomprehensible to anyone. Her grasp on written English is tenuous at best. By far the worst professor in the department.At first, I didn&#39;t like her. She was too hyper, her notes and homeworks were poorly formatted. But my opinion changed when I actually interacted with her. She&#39;s EXTREMELY sweet and genuinely cares about you, the material, and making sure you get it. Pay attention, work hard and you&#39;ll do awesomely.Dr. Wickham cares a lot about getting the material across and is genuinely a very good person. For that reason alone she is one of my favorite professors. Her lectures are a bit fast, and she clearly drinks A LOT of caffeine, but many people find her style exciting\/refreshing. Assignments are very thorough and help a lot. Lots of work but worth itProfessor Wickham is a really good professor, but she suffers from a lack of clarity sometimes. It&#39;s tough to tell when she&#39;s moving on to a new topic.  That said, she knows the material really well and the problem sets prepare you well for the exams. Wickham reminds me of the principal from School of Rock.Disorganized and confusing lecture format. She just throws information at you for 55 minutes nonstop, constantly running out of breath. The class and material could&#39;ve been taught in a much better way. The lectures are extremely quick. However, if you put in the time and attend all of her lectures, the class is reasonable and fair. To be honest, she&#39;s one of my favorite professor&#39;s at Cornell because she is so upbeat about all of our lectures.By far the worst professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Unable to express herself clearly (or concisely), stutters through lectures, consistently poor choices of notation, and generally terrible presentation of otherwise interesting material. I can&#39;t believe she will be the only professor I&#39;ll have for more than one class here.Lectures very unclear. Problem sets unclear and long.Definitely the worst professor I have had at Cornell. Lectures are way too fast, and she doesn&#39;t stop to explain anything. Exams and problem sets are hard, and I came away from the class feeling like I hadn&#39;t learned anything. Terrible class.She&#39;s a very organized and knows her stuff, but lectures WAYYYY too fast. Course covered twice as much material as it should have. Students were frequently clueless when it came to the lengthy, time-consuming homeworks.

Requires a lot of textbook reading. If you are taking this class (as an Animal Science major) limit your schedule. If you&#39;re not required to take this class with this professor, don&#39;t.Tests are very hard and you have to be able to spit the book back out for each questions and know everything in great detail. I only took the class because it is required.Extremely hard class, expects students to know everythingDr. Selvaraj is a wonderful professor who truly cares about his students.  This is not an easy class by any means, but if you put in the necessary work (attend all lectures, go to office hours, do the readings), you will be fine.  1100 serves as a great intro to the field of animal science and will really show you if it is the right major for you.Extremely difficult.  Moves extremely quickly through topics. Focuses so much on details that the big picture is hard to understand. Expects students to already know the everything he is discussing.This is the classic Cornell weed-out course for pre-vets. Take advantage of outside resources like your textbook when you don&#39;t understand something. Labs are helpful for review\/ understanding material, ask your TA&#39;s lots of questions, they are full of advice. Attend lecture, you will fail otherwise and sit and study for hours to pass prelims.Clear lecturer that really knows his stuff and will help you understand it. The lectures are dense, and there will be a lot of that material on tests. Labs are a ton of fun tooGreat class with a great professor.  Quizzes and tests rely heavily on the textbook and diagrams, but if you take the class seriously, you learn a lot and will do fine.Let&#39;s give this guy a break! He&#39;s a good person and a fantastic teacher, he just gave difficult exams. Most people failed to note that the exams CAME STRAIGHT FROM HIS POWERPOINTS!! And, when people didn&#39;t do well, he set up extra class times to help people out. This class was still a ton of work, but it was worth it and hes not a bad guy.Expectations for the class are ridiculously high for and an introductory level. Expected to memorize an extensive amount of material, much of which you aren&#39;t even tested on. Moves quickly through concepts and either does not know or does not care that the class is not keeping up.Dr. Selvaraj is a fantastic professor.  He asks a lot of his students, but not only is it to push them to be better, but also to give them a taste of what vet school will be like. The class was not easy at all, but if you have a strong interest in the subject, I highly recommend it. He is willing to help you whenever you need it. Overall great guy.Dr. Selvaraj is a great professor and extremely interested in helping his students succeed. Older reviews reference a class which has since been improved in the areas that students found difficult during the first couple of years. It is still a difficult course but is by no means unreasonable - it takes work, but so will vet school!Amazing professor and one of the most brilliant people I have ever met. He teaches a tough class but it is worth every moment. If you put in your effort he will make this class the best you takeDr. Selvaraj is very kind and is very clear what is important for exams in his lectures. Although the class is not easy, it is a necessary foundation and gives you a great head start on the rest of your animal science courses. If you worked hard on this course and followed all of the resources he gives you, there will be no problem and do well.Extremely interesting class, and Selvaraj is an amazing lecturer. Definitely the hardest course I&#39;ve taken at Cornell, thoughProf. Selverage runs a very challenging course but for many Animal Science majors the class is a taste of what vet school will be like. He is VERY kind man if you get to know him and will work as hard as you do if you just go to him. No doubt that the amount of information is a lot at times but if you are thinking\/planning on vet school, take it.Not at all helpful, hard to understand the points he is trying to make. Assumes the class knows what he knows. Moves super fast and without alot of clarity. Avoid his classes if you can!This class is the perfect way to test whether or not you really want to go to vet school. This class gives you a foundation for all of your future animal classes, making life much easier as you move to other higher level courses. It&#39;s not an easy class but completely worth working through and is very rewarding. Lectures are important in doing well.New teacher, seems interested in what he is talking about, but he&#39;s a VET. Not a teacher. He assumes massive prior knowledge of the subject matte. You are required to memorize a 500 page textbook word-for-word to pass weekly quizzes.

If you are a dairy student struggling through the ANSC required classes, don&#39;t worry he does a lot of lectures that tie into basic dairy knowledge with regard to repro. It is challenging, but only if you make it that way. Attend lecture, take notes by hand, go to review sessions, and ask questions!Dr. Allen is one of the nicest professors I have ever met. He truly cares about every one of his students. He makes lectures fun with jokes, memes, and stories. You definitely have to study hard to get a good grade, but he also gives out extra credit. He picks really good TAs that are also extremely helpful. I wish all my professors were like Dr. ADr. Allen is genuinely kind and understanding. In lectures, he takes time to thoroughly explain concepts while keeping students&#39; attention during longer and complicated topics. He has a fantastic sense of humor but maintains respect. During office hours, he is receptive to all questions and willing to meet additionally for any reason if needed.Dr. Allen is one of the best professors and individuals I&#39;ve had the pleasure of receiving.

Her tests are multiple choice for the most part and test on random numbers and facts rather than concepts. Terrible class.Awful class and professor.Wants to make the class legit, presents very easy material in class, and tests on random facts that are not important to know if you are going into the equine field. She is not helpful or friendly, worst class i have taken.Considering it was her first year teaching, she did a great job. I&#39;ve been around horses a while but still found much of the class info. valuable. The labs could be boring, but I bet those will get better over time, too.

Good professors should not only encourage students to share different ideas, but they should also have an open-mind themselves. Someone truly committed to education adapts his\/her view when wrong. Joe is the complete opposite of this and believes his view is infallible.I&#39;ve had Professor Cherney for 3 classes and she is always awesome. She explains things very well and is always available to her students. She makes her classes fun and is very fair when it comes to grading. A great Professor.If you ask him (or even if you don&#39;t) Professor Regenstein will tell you he invented the world and everything in it. He surely thinks quite highly of himself and it gets in the way of his ability to teach. In a class where opinions can and should differ greatly he certainly believes his is the only one that matters.Dr. Cherney is a very sweet person.

The grading is pretty easy, but seriously, I&#39;m pretty sure she makes up 80% of the lecture material, the other 20% coming right from the ridiculous long textbook readings.DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! It is one of the worst classes I have ever taken.  You read over 1,000 pages in articles some of which are interesting, but that have absolutely no connection to each other. You learn hundreds of random facts about people you will never care about in the future. Most of the time the lectures do not even mention food.This is a worthless class in which the professor exoticizes and stereotypes different groups. She thinks French food is the best, tribal people are all loving and communal and that Asian people eat strange things. Worthless!Worst professor at Cornell by far.

She is a really impressive professor and her class discussed highly interesting and engaging topics. Definitely recommend her! I loved this class! Hodzic is a good professor - her lectures are always about readings for homework (if you want a good grade, you need to talk in the class). They&#39;re usually really cool though.

Will miss him very much since he recently retired from teaching.Elizabeth Meyer clearly cares about printmaking - but her feedback is semi-helpful at best and downright demeaning at worst. I frequently was given better direction by the TA and technician. At least for introduction to Print, the workload was intense.Professor Page is one of the most supportive people in the Fine Art department at Cornell AAP.

He does not know what he is talking about, makes mean and hurtful comments to you and thinks it&#39;s ok as long as he laughs afterwards. He is judgmental and not at all positive, and is very objective about what he wants in a photo so creativity is honestly not an option.Frequently seems to care more about how well you can explain your work than the quality of the work itself.

She makes me hate photo so much that I don&#39;t want to even go near the photo darkroom.Class is not worth all of the extra outside work. 4 credits for a 3 hour class that meets 2x a week, yet you are spending hours and hours outside class printing for critique. Means well but gives harsh criticism and seems to have trouble understanding other people&#39;s artistic perspectives that differ from hers.I was so excited to take this class when I enrolled, but it&#39;s been the most stressful class of my semester.

Her enthusiasm for the topic really show in her lectures.Agreed that she was nice, but she didn&#39;t have much to be mean about, TAs take care of the grading, etc. If you can&#39;t stand NYC-metro area accents though, this class will drive you insane.Treats works in her lecture simplistically, with little historical context. Dismisses important things with blanket statements! She is also not very articulate in bringing about her point, as simple as it sometimes may be.she likes her subject, enthusiasm is contagiousOne of the best classes in the College of Arts and Sciences.  Appropriate amount of reading, fascinating lectures, opportunities to pursue independent interests and critique art.  Her enthusiasm is contagious.  This class gives you the essential (albeit Eurocentric) developments in the modern era.  Downside: too many greek system people.Very interesting course!

One of my favorite professors of my freshman year.This class is great. You can argue anything as long as you have the historical\/artist background to validate your claim. If you stay half-awake in lecture you can gather all the information needed to do well on the tests. Grades are determined by your ta, but all the fine art majors greatly lower their expectations of your writing. Overall easy A.Bernstock was the worst lecturer I&#39;ve ever had the displeasure of having. She was erratic, confusing, confusing, unprofessional, and boring. She managed to sour one of my absolute favorite topics of learning with her in-class outbursts. The class itself was not very enlightening and I would certainly recommend avoiding it. I like how 20% of the grade was based on participation because the Professor was rlly nice and super easy to talk to. When I took it in the summer, he was willing to meet us outside class to discuss about our assignments. Briefly reading the assigned textbook pages outside class would do. However, heavy memorization for prelims\/finals.Professor Bernstock is a wonderful teacher, enthusiastic and knowledgeable. I graduated some years ago, but I still remember and talk to people about what I learned in her art history class. She is truly inspiring, plus she is friendly and down to earth--very willing to meet with students.I actually am not very fond of this teacher. I absolutely love art history, but I cannot stand her class. She seems incredibly knowledgeable about the subject. Unfortunately, a little too knowledgable.

Does this mean she has to be nasty?  Does this mean I don&#39;t work hard?  I felt like she was more than a little unreasonable and moody.Boring, uninformed, talks endlessly about barely related concepts, and does play favorites.  I went to her office and thought she was quite nasty with just the two of us there.  She might be the worst professor I&#39;ve ever had.Worst ever.  She&#39;s never in class, doesn&#39;t prepare, and doesn&#39;t make sense when she does.Grades too harshly, plays favorites, appears to have more problems with female students.

That&#39;s completely false! She set the MAXIMUM page limit at 12 pages, and most students stopped around 6~8 pages. I wasn&#39;t even interested in Japan before but her lecture style and TAs helped greatly. Highly recomm.I think that this class is easy if you pay attention and do the readings. There are multiple articles she supplies on Blackboard, in addition to the few books she asks you to buy. I think this class was fantastic, and was really interesting.Absolutely ridiculous amount of work and reading. We were expected to read a 200+ page book over a weekend. There is no way that the median grade is an A. No standards for grading whatsoever. We had no idea what would contribute to our final grade or how. Grades were assigned virtually arbitrarily. Take Intro to China instead...One of the best teachers I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Intelligent, passionate about the subject material, loves to engage with students.Honestly, my favourite class so far at Cornell. Every single one of her lectures was extremely interesting to listen to. The class was well structured and comprehensive, allowing students to examine Japan from a variety of perspectives. &#34;Required&#34; film screenings outside of class were also fun. A lot of work, but an extremely fulfilling class.She&#39;s an amazing person and an amazing lecturer but word to the wise- either skip the readings or skip lecture (you won&#39;t want to though, she&#39;s so funny and interesting) but don&#39;t do both. You have to write your papers on something. And even if you get all As on your papers DO THE BONANZA POINTS AND MAKE SURE YOUR TA KNOWS YOU DID THEM!Her lectures are super inspirational and information-intense. Assignments are a bit confusing because of her flow-of-conscious writing style, but you can definitely make sure of them if you email her or use office hours. This class asks you to do perceptive learning, not literary analysis all the times. Besides this, just enjoy your class!Clearly knows what she is teaching, but but rather inconsiderate of individual schedules.  Listen: I understand that you want to have summaries to make sure we are attending lecture, but to keep these on a week we have a quiz AND an essay AND a movie AND a 2 essay take home final isn&#39;t fair to us or your two TAs who do 90% of your grading.Jane Marie-Law knows Japan extremely well and uses her class as a gateway to observe Japanese through multiple lenses. If you are interested in cultural analysis her class is enjoyable. There are many opportunities to earn extra credits---&#34;bonanza points&#34;---so getting an A won&#39;t be a problem. Definitely go to her office hours. You&#39;d learn more.She is really popular! As CS &amp; Stats major I hate history\/social studies class and took this one for distribution requirement, but Professor Law actually made me enjoy the class! Her way of teaching makes the classes extremely interesting and inspirational. Readings &amp; lectures are not mandatory. No final exam, and only a few papers needed. Not hardThe most work I&#39;ve ever had a humanities intro class. Lots of readings, but if it the subject interests you then it will be fairly easy to stay on top of things.Professor Law is one of the best professors I have had so far at Cornell.

I especially enjoyed that he picked a lot of colorful and engaging primary sources rather than dry commentary. This class gives an excellent survey of religion in Asia and provides a good foundation for future investigation.Prof Boucher is enthusiastic and I like his style of lecturing. Just attend all the lectures and your discussion and you won&#39;t have any issue writing the papers or the weekly response. Very reasonable workload. Prof offers useful office hours anytime you want to schedule them with him outside of class.Professor Boucher seems like a pretty good professor, the classes do not have too much work and the material is genuinely interesting to learn about, especially how the class frames it. Most interesting class I have taken at Cornell yet.Perhaps the virus brought out his dark side. Boucher is bar none the worst prof at Cornell. Zoom Lectures are a quick 2-5 minute long recap of old Asian text, and then there is a huge disconnect between the fake on the hw he assigns. He is angry and going to office hours is just demeaning, you ask for help he rubs it in you.I have taken several classes with this professor, and she is absolutely phenomenal. I imagine that the criticisms from other raters stem from the fact that they do not care much for serious academics\/learning. Yes, her courses are more demanding than others in the humanities. However, you also learn much more. She is eloquent and charismatic. A++The professor is definitely passionate about the material, but he can come off as abrasive\/irreverent during lectures (which are completely technology-free by the way--no powerpoints). Weekly assignments, a couple easy quizzes, and two big papers. As far as stress\/workload, nbd. But I left with less enthusiasm for the subject than I came in with.She is a brilliant teacher and a very impressive and inspiring personality. I was lucky I got to interact with her. She is passionate and serious about the subject and inspires the students to make a good effort. Her&#39;s was one of the best classes I have taken. I wholeheartedly recommend any class taught by Prof. Law to anyone.I guess your grade will mostly depend on the TA. In my case, I didn&#39;t have much assistance and so I just over studied to make up for the lack of guidance. The prof isnt helpful so expect doing much more than you signed up for. He took interesting subjects and some how managed to make them dreadful. The rules to grading change to stay pay attention.Prof. Boucher was honestly one of the best professors I&#39;ve had in Cornell. He was always very enthusiastic about his work and he made sure all of the concepts taught in the class were thoroughly discussed. For this class, just make sure you do the readings and you reach out when you are confused about anything!A great lecturer and a ridiculously interesting topic. Lectures aren&#39;t mandatory but you won&#39;t want to miss any of them. He is a very clear speaker and really holds your attention. One page paper due every week, three quizzes and two papers. A pretty easy class but he speaks very quickly, get a digital recorder so you don&#39;t miss what he says!His lectures were some of the most interesting I&#39;ve attended at Cornell. The class was a nice break from some of the more technical courses I took in the semester, and the workload was pretty mild. I didn&#39;t interact with him in person, but he seemed fairly accessible as a professor, and made pretty generous course accomodations during the pandemicThe professor takes a topic that has a lot of potential to be fascinating but makes it somewhat dry, he&#39;s just talking at you for 50 minutes without usually incorporating videos or pictures. He&#39;s very passionate though and if you take good notes the quizzes are easy, and you don&#39;t really have to do readings.If you do the homeworks (which are easy) and go to class, you&#39;ll get an A+Quiz preparation is vague, unhelpful feedback on papers and discussion responses, hardest class of my semester and it was not even for my major!Take someone else.

Definitely engaged with his work.friendly but awkward to talk to. seems to be nervous when you to talk to him, so i was never sure if he didn&#39;t want to answer my question or was just awkward. grading is easy. essay and finals are about taking notes of what he says and repeat them in your essay and final. dont even have to read, goes over same stuff in class.","difficulty":3.5,"rating":2.5},{"index":759,"prof_name":"Robin McNeal","prof_dept":"Asian Studies","class_name":"ASIAN3302","comment":"McNeal is my fav prof at Cornell.

She genuinely cares for her students and takes interest in your work. Also, her lectures are full of passion (very funny too ) She is the sole reason why I became an Asian Studies major. You&#39;ll never regret taking her class.Professor Law is extremely knowledgeable in the subject area of Japanese Religion and is one of the most engaging professors I&#39;ve had here at Cornell. I regret not taking a class with her sooner; it has been a great experience.There a few professors at Cornell University more passionate about their subject matter than Professor Law but, as a human being who truly understands the plights of her students there are none that surpass her. If at all interested in religious studies please take one of her classes because her positive attitude and outlook are truly infectious!Professor Law has an extremely lively lecturing style and a great sense of humor. She is incredibly knowledgeable about Japanese Religion, drawing on both her fieldwork and from contemporary theory. She cares about her students and puts in the effort to meet students&#39; individual needs. High but worthwhile workload for a 3000 level class.Wonderful professor - very thoughtful and caring. She clearly loves her job and puts tremendous effort into every aspect of it. I&#39;ve learned so much from a semester of her teaching. She keeps her students in rapture for the entire lecture - I don&#39;t even mind when we go a little over the time limit. The work is challenging, but not impossible.Prof Law is the best lecturer I&#39;ve had at Cornell, and solely taking this course for her paid off because it was fascinating. The course had a great religious, cultural and historical perspective on Japan. The workload is manageable with time management and the writing makes the class worthwhile. Law is there to help you at and point along the way.Really awesome teacher, very lenient, very fun, really interested in her stuff. She gets off track on tangents sometimes, but that really makes the class more interesting, it travels instead of stagnates. In her class you gotta take care of you though, she helps but you need to keep track of your own work, she wont do it for you.","difficulty":3.0,"rating":4.8571428571},{"index":765,"prof_name":"Jane Marie Law","prof_dept":"Religious Studies","class_name":"ASIAN3359","comment":"A self-righteous, arrogant and condescending, feminist hypocrite.

I never expected to learn, let alone understand, astrophysics with this much ease, but she is so, so excellent at making the material approachable to even the most science-challenged people like myself.includes news on astronomy in class, loves what she doesinteresting lectures, do the homework and go to sections and the class will be easyif you want to learn about astronomy, this is a great intro classdiscusses newest results in class, clear grading guidelinesReally interesting lecture, discusses newest results in astronomy. Engaging teaching style. Asks many questions in class. Accessible outside class in office hours or email. Gave a talk in same section as Stephen Hawking and met the Pope this semester.inspiring lecturer, searches from signs of life on exoplanets, is also the director of the Carl Sagan Institute at CornellIf you want to know about our place in the cosmos, take this class.finally I can say my professor is on netflix IMAX movie &#34;Search for Life in Space&#34;Class is fun and inspiring. Professor is amazing.Lloyd&#39;s lectures are mostly good.  He does lots of demos that are really entertaining.  The class is pretty easy, but there are homeworks and you need to study for the exams.Professor Kaltenegger is truly inspiring.

This course is pretty dry with some interesting topics towards the end of the semester.  Professor Herter&#39;s prelims and final are not hard as long as you do the practice tests and memorize stuff from lecture slides.  Easy class but very very dry.The class does not have too much rigor or content... mostly nice pictures... Not recommend if you want to get some education.Amazing professor and passionate about what she does. Lecturers are interesting and engaging. She wants you to truly learn the material and succeed.a great introduction to astronomyAstro 1101 is a joke.  The professor makes it sound exciting but it&#39;s all in her head.  She is completely self absorbed and there&#39;s no content in this class. This class is just for students to get an easy PBS requirement.Lectures are long and confusing but sometimes there is interesting stuff particularly via guest lectures. Prof cares so much about the class and her grading policy is so nice its insane.

I was actually sad when I finished my final.Although Prof Stacey is a really nice guy, with an obvious enthusiasm and brilliance for astronomy, his &#34;intro&#34; lectures assume that students have a wealth of &#34;common&#34; astro knowledge... much too difficult to follow.Professor Stacey assumes that students have a fairly large background knowledge, but is extremely helpful with explanations and understanding humanities students&#39; occasional difficulties with math\/science. Really fun engaging class.Professor Stacey is brilliant!  He is enthusiastic about astronomy and injects passion into his lecture. Astro 195 is also nice in that its roster is limited to 24 students. To be fair, astro 195 is a bit hard for humanities majors with little background in math or physics.Professor Stacey is a great and very smart guy, with an awkward-funny sense of humor, but, like others have said, he assumes that you have a decent amount of background knowledge.

Not the coolest guy, unfortunately.Datta is awesome. He really wants everyone to understand the material, and explains things well. I feel like I may actually remember the material for some time.

He makes a lot of effort to help each student who asks for help. Lectures are clear and informative, and recitation is a great way to learn how to approach problems.One of the best professors I ever met in Cornell! Very considerate, and always there for his students. Love him!He&#39;s welling to help and he wants to teach well for sure, you can tell from the enthusiasm.  However, some of the homeworks and prelim  problems are poorly worded\/made.  It&#39;s just so hard to figure out what the question is asking or what the diagram is showing. You have to talk to him and after awhile you get it but there&#39;s no time on the test...He&#39;s great! Best lecturer I&#39;ve had so far.Professor Datta is extremely invested in his students and it shows.  Even though his prelims can be tricky at times, if you do a bunch of problems from the back of the book and go to office hours for homework help, you&#39;ll be in good shape.Amazing prof. Genuinely cares about students, and his lectures are extremely clear and helpful. Course is also very relevant to BEE. One of the best profs in the BEE department and at Cornell.Probably the best professor I have ever had.Very explicit about expectations and the conceptsskills he expects you to have down. Several resources to learn by, including text and lecture notes.Professor Datta is by far the best engineering professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell . The courses structure, the spiral bound course notes, lifesaving problem solving charts and his ability to teach, really allow you to develop a true understanding of the topics. Unlike other eng courses he actually wants you to do well in his class.Professor is a little condescending and often goes over the time limit for class, which is rough when it&#39;s all the way up in Riley Robb, but the class is very well-organized and he is more than willing to help people who are struggling. I highly recommend attending the discussion section. Great professor who knows his stuff.

He&#39;s so disorganized and gets mad at students for not understanding the material (when he&#39;s the one teaching so poorly). The avg for the first prelim was extremely low. 3600 is interesting material but he just killed it for me. He mumbles and has awful handwriting.Not the most organized professor (his handwriting is terrible- sorry, March!), but knows his stuff and, since he likes it when people understand, is pretty good with questions. Prelims suffer a bit from disorganization but overall not terribleHe has gotten A LOT better at teaching. He&#39;s very clear now, organized, and asks reasonable questions on exams.

Arrogant but not very intelligent (the word is quit, not quiet!).  He hasn&#39;t taught the class in a while and people still feel very strongly about him.This class has a severe lack of instruction. Something about this course must drastically change in order to prevent more students from losing hope in studying biology. &#34;Tommy O&#34; is very unhelpful and unclear.

He would have to throw out 8\/50 questions\/test b\/c they were designed to confuse and weed out those whose interest in being a Bio major wasn&#39;t strong enough. I can&#39;t understand the apologists who have posted about his class.  The only people who would defend him are those who did well.  Great, you deciphered his questionsprobably the most discouraging professor ever. He is not so much interested in helping you learn as humiliating you for not knowing the information. His tests also test your ability to decipher his cryptic questions more than they test your actual knowledge of the material.At times he can be very ambigious but he is avery smart professor.  He test are very hard.  He put a lot of emphasis on thinking.  If you can do well in his class then other bio courses are a piece of cake!This guy is tough. The lecture is not really helpful but if you stay on top of what he is teaching, you can come out with an A\/A-\/B+\/B. If not, hope for the best.hard class.difficul to get an A. material is ALOT and to answer questions correctly you need to UNDERSTAND and not memorize.course work is worth much more than 2 credits.very knowledgeble professor.like to make students think.he is very fair with his students.Okay, so he&#39;s smart and lectures are organized. But this fact is overpowered by how rude, self-centered and unhelpful he is. I once went to ask him a question that he must have found too simple so he asked my grade thus far in the course. When I said B+, he told me I was lying if I asked such questions and told me to try reading the book.somewhat interestingFirst of all, yes i did well on his class but i have done well in all the classes i have taken at Cornell so the reason i defend him is not because i got a good grade but beacause he is an intelligent professor who challenges student to learn things on their own.  Last time i checked,Cornell was an IVY league so quiet complainng people!owens doesn&#39;t test biology, he tests your ability to figure out his convoluted questions.  this man makes me want to be an english major!He&#39;s both a horrible professor and a horrible individual.  He has no respect for people in other professions, and especially seems to put down chemistry academians. A week before prelims, he tells you if you haven&#39;t started studying, you will fail when you can&#39;t study for his exams anyway because he asks trick questions.boo on tom owens.  i hate this man. wtf, how can you say that you made a test too hard and that you&#39;re going to make the next easier, and THEN have the average go DOWN FOUR PERCENT!! hmmmmTotal jackass with an ego complex.  The class is a weed out class but your grade is not determined by your intelligence at all and rather by how big of a nerd you are while reading the text for hours on end.  I got a B+ in this class (both 101 and 102) and A+ both semesters of orgo.Tough class, learned how to think in another way. Not worth taking if class is not needed or if you have AP credit. Still do not understand why this class has such a low mean while other classes like intro to bio have much higher means. Does not help anyone by weeding out anyone.yo tom owens was a good professor. yes, he was hard, but at the same time he was very, very helpful. the class was helpful in the sense that it taught us how to &#39;think.&#39;   people complain about him because they don&#39;t do well in the course.Tom Owens&#39; office hours philosophy: don&#39;t ask the question if you don&#39;t already know the answer. Someone needs to punch this c**ksucker in the eye like 50 cent did Ja Rule.Professor Ownes is a great teacher. If you want to really learn bio then you should definately take his class.  However if you care more about your grades than learning bio then you should aviod his class. His test are very hard but they are logical. Memorizing the fact and reading the book is not enough in Professor Owens class.CONFUSING, you cannot get awaay with the book, alot of reading and alot of thinking.lectures are a complete waste of time.  the man will teach you nothing in class.  the books helps some, but you really need a mind reader to do well on his exams. all in all, a horrible professor who preferred to put people down rather than help them.  avoid this class if you can.No CommentsProfessor Owens, even though sometimes he is rude to his students, is one of the best professors at Cornell. By best i mean, he actaully make his students think about what they are reading. So if you are a person who likes to memorize stuff don&#39;t take professor owen&#39;s class.I had T.O. last year for bio 101, and, in short, I wanted to kill myself.  Not only is he extremely condescending, he also made what should have been somewhat manageable material into an over-complicated, over-technologized mess.Just not a very good prof. Contradicts easily searchable facts too frequently.  Also adamant that he was right when he made mistakes. I also found his grading style unhelpful and unpredictable.A sweet old man who is very fairDr Walcott is the coolest!!!

At the same time though, Professor Owens was very passionate about the material and it was easy to see that he wanted us all to learn. The TAs were ok.great professorbetter than meisnerI love his lecturesHis classtime stories are the best!Tests test whether u can decipher his riddle-like wording.  I wanna throw my clicker at him.Dr. Owens&#39; exams are definitely difficult. BUT, I suppose it helps us in the long run. It&#39;s true that many of us can only absorb facts. We need to be able to look at &#34;the whole picture&#34;. Even if we&#39;re having a tough time with this class even after going to office hours and 001 sessions...I took bio 101 with professor owens freshman year. like many arts and sciences majors, i wasn&#39;t sure if I wanted to major in bio. Professor Owens uncaring attitude was very harsh and made many of us loose interest. Only now, much later, am I finally regaining my interest in biology. don&#39;t take him if you want to keep your interest in biology up!Owens can only be described as a professor who hates teaching, he&#39;s obviously only here to do research and students are just an obligatory burden. He does not care how you do and he is &#34;weeding out everyone else from the doctors&#34;... well I don&#39;t want to be a doctor... consider me weeded! A photographic memory is a plus in this class.I hate this ****.  He says one thing, then says the opposite.  He doesn&#39;t answer questions that people may have.  This class is horrible.  Teachers are suppose to be willing to help students and he fails to do this.He seems like a really nice guy, but his lectures are incredibly boring (really bad) and he goes through complicated things too quickly.No CommentsWrites questions on tests to trick students instead of testing comprehension.

While he may be a good lecturer, it is not helpful to ask him questions unless you know everything about the material, and then what is the point of asking questions?No CommentsWarning: Stay CLEAR of Owens. He has no idea what students want. He is heartless. He can&#39;t teach introductory biology. He wastes half of each class seeing whether we did the reading, instead of actually teaching the material to us! HORRIBLE...I like his lectures. The diagrams are great !!His lectures were informative but boring, he chose some really random and irrelevant things to go in depth with. Otherwise really helpful though. Good use of powerpoints and the clicker questions were actually helpful. For prelims though, your best bet is to just memorize the book. It&#39;s a challenging class, but not impossible.&#34;I&#39;ll wait till its queit people&#34;  He comes off as a grade school teacher but does know how to teach.1) nice **** short shorts, Tom. 2) he was advisor and made me cry because I didn&#39;t explain the Krebs cycle correctly in an advising meeting with him 3) after this class i switched from bio major to french major 4)this class sucks and Tom is mean!No CommentsNo CommentsNo CommentsAfter his class, I switched from Bio\/Pre-med to Govt\/Pre-Law.  What I learned from this class: 1)I hate bio 2)I will never take a class with Owens again.Difficult, but good. I learned a hell of a lot which I have since forgotten.He&#39;s very enthusiatic and willing to help anybodyHe treats the class like we&#39;re morons, and makes questions that test niether facts nor broad concepts, they test reading comprehension because the man can&#39;t write. For christ&#39;s sake, 1\/5 of his last test had more than one answer!Owens goes fast and covers a lot of material, but does so very well.  Seems sort of cocky in lecture, but is great one on one.I&#39;m sure Tom Owens wasn&#39;t treated nearly as badly as a freshman as he treats his students. He&#39;s a poor excuse of a scientist, teacher and a person if he can be so rotten to someone who doesn&#39;t know as much as he does. I&#39;m ashamed as a biologist (Cornell Grad) that people like him are in the field.crazy test questionsTommy O is obsessed with clicker questions,and spends no time actually going over the material. yet he still wonders why we all don&#39;t understand.

Save yourself the headache and take another class.Honestly a horrible teacher. I really tried in this class and he offered no help. I went to his office hours to reach out for help and he smiled at my struggle and tears. On top of this is lectures are irrelevant and incredibly boring. I would not recommend this class to anyone that I like.Professor Turgeon seems to actually wants his students to fail. The exams test the smallest most ridiculous bits of information that may or may not have been mentioned in class, and you really have to understand how to apply the information taught in class for the tests. The TA&#39;s are great though and section can actually be enjoyable.He is so dull; class material is dull; he does not plan tests in sync with material on theme (tends to be random), overall terrible experience.

Easily the worst mistake I&#39;ve made since coming here has been taking this class in the fall with him. TF Qs ONLY, a confusing as hell examgroup exam grading system, and a CURVED PARTICIPATION GRADE made this easily the worst class experience I have so far.STAY AWAY FROM THIS MAN.

He likes to say that he and his daughter worked so much harder than all of us in college. he curved the class to a B-class wasn&#39;t organized well, material seemed scattered, and tests were largely ambiguous multiple choice. i still came out okay, but not because of silva. honestly seems like he&#39;s focused more on stand up than on teaching when he lectures. but outside of class he seems like a pretty fun guy. just not a great teacherI put so much effort into this class, but still got killed by the course. True\/false exams were really tricky.Im not going to lie, I didn&#39;t understand a single lecture from this professor. It seems like he cares, but I was complexity lost when trying to study from my notes and his sparse slides. Would not recommend, sorry !

Then half the final grades posted were wrong and the final grades reposted - WOW!Uses a textbook that is designed for upperclassmen and grad students, which is extremely dense. His lectures seem okay, but you have to read the textbook in order to actually understand the material at the depth he wants and do well on his exams. Extremely difficult class that is way more work than an introductory class should be.Good teacher. His questions are overrated because he thinks that they&#39;re hard, but they really aren&#39;t and you don&#39;t even need to study.

The online book is worthless.If you have ever taken a biology course before, you will pass. If not, this is a good way to get hands on experience with lab techniques. definitely take this your freshman year, you&#39;ll hate yourself otherwise.Take caution because Savary has an accent like Tommy Wiseau from The Room. Take this class freshman year because it is taught at a snail&#39;s pace.BIO 1500 is an insult to everyone required to take it. Lectures are mandatory, but don&#39;t teach anything useful. Labs are three hours long, and you aren&#39;t allowed to leave early, even though the material takes 15 minutes. The only upside is how easy this course is- if you passed 5th grade math, you will get an A. Avoid this course if you can.The class is super easy and even if you can&#39;t understand his lectures (which I totally could anyway), very little of the material is new as long as you had decent bio in high school. He&#39;s funny and friendly, even though some find him intimidating. Also I love his accent.Good lecturer genuinely enthusiastic about the class, but labs are long and boring. Tests are easy and papers and projects are clearly outlined\/understood.One of the worst courses I&#39;ve taken in Cornell partly because of the lecturers and partly because the tediousness of lab. Chen conducts the class with professionalism and with an iron fist. She is very strict but don&#39;t be afraid because she&#39;s like that with everyone. As a lecturer, she was monotonous. Wished she  made the course more interesting.Lectures used clickers when I took it, and I had a night lab taught by a grad student. The lab usually was let out early, thankfully. Basically the course was fine and taught basic scientific design and literacy through a biological lens. The prof also helped me land a spot despite the course being full.Literally you could learn the entire semester&#39;s material in a day on your own.

The class itself was very intense and rigorous. You dont have to wake up for lecture and you can skip material you already know, but reading text book alone can be depressing sometimes. You dont have to read the text book, just *memorize* the objectives, good way to develop study habits.This class has a huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge workload, but in the end you learn alot and it&#39;s pretty interesting.  The prof was helpful and nice.Like with most auto classes, what you get out is directly correlated to how much time and effort you put into it - you can get a lot of out this class by learning the material thoroughly. Didn&#39;t  have a lot of contact with the prof, but his review sessions were great and he seemed accessible and helpful. Actually one of my favorite classes here.Best autotutorial class at Cornell. Possibly best Biology class. Jim is clear and organized and WANTS YOU TO DO WELL. Class is organized around this basic motive, so oral tests are not graded, written tests are fair, and prelims are very fair too! No complaints. The material was really interesting too. Workload not too bad.You will remember this class for your entire life. Excellent auto-tutorial course. The optional &#34;review&#34; sessions led by Jim are good refreshers for exams or before Unit tests. Workload=life consuming. Talk to TAs in the center and clear questions up ASAP. Jim is always in the center helping TAs with unit test, grading, tutoring.The autotutorial class is so absurdly hard I bled a little. I still enjoyed the material and learned a lot. The prof constructed a really solid challenging class.He&#39;s an ok guy, personally though, I thought he was sorta condescending to certain students at times- so for that I think the guy is a bit of an ass.  I&#39;m guessing all these great reviews he&#39;s getting are from his &#34;favorite&#34; students.  Review sessions were helpful though, the test were hard but if you studied you would do fine.auto-tutorial biochem is a lot of work...stay on track and ask the ta&#39;s for helpA really nice guy, even though the course is hard, he doesn&#39;t mind helping you out, although he will refer you to the undergrad TA&#39;s for help first. I think he prefers dealing with the administrative end. his help sessions are VERY thorough re: the tests.Jim is a great teacher and is fair to all of the students. (Some other person thought he only helped pre-meds). He is a wealth of knowledge and will help anyone who seeks him out.Definitely don&#39;t be narrowminded.  It&#39;s not hard material, but it&#39;s definitely a lot of work and a lot of memorization.  The review sessions headed by Blankenship are extremely helpful as long as you don&#39;t get distracted by his personality.Jim is an awesome guy and a great teacher. He makes the material easy to understand..it&#39;s a shame that such a good teacher is heading an auto-tutorial courseNo CommentsNo CommentsThis guy&#39;s not only very knowledgable, but extremely nice in person. A word of general advice, though: don&#39;t be narrow-minded.Jim was only helpful to pre-meds.  He made it very difficult for me to get extra help with him, and reserved his hours for his favorite students.  This is BY FAR the worst class I have ever taken at Cornell. Even Genetics is a cake-walk compared to this.No CommentsJim is the Best!!!the class is autotutorial. And yet it has some of the best lectures I&#39;ve attended at Cornell.

I finished my first year of medical school, and my preparation for biochemistry was far superior to that of my classmates&#39;, based on what I learned in BIOBM331. On another note, he&#39;s also one of the most approachable professors I&#39;ve met.EXCELLENT prof...way cooler than most bio profs at this university...he understands the student perspective and really helps you to do well...he def makes you work your butt off for your grade!!! (also makes you love the subject in the meantime) This was the best bio class I took at Cornell.Challenging and informative course. It isnt easy, but he makes you want to study as much as possible, just to make him happy. He makes such an effort on your behalf that you&#39;re guilted into trying your best. AMAZING PROF, probably my best biology teacher ever.i hate biochem but he is a good prof. knows the**** and has very interesting lectures for them being about reactions in a cell.Feigenson is one of the most genuine professors at Cornell.Talk to him!He really wants to get to know you!An added bonus:he can actually teach.You&#39;ll never fall asleep in his class and he is very fair in his grading.BioBM 331 has been the best science class I&#39;ve taken at Cornell and I&#39;m a bio major.Very good!  He tells you what you need to know, and then tests you on it.  Very straightforward.  Excellent teacher.Amazing professor who genuinely cares about teaching. His passion for the subject really shows during lectures and simplifies a lot of stuff so very understandable and intersting as well. Surprisingly low amount of memorization required. way to an A: master lecture notes(understanding is the key), do previous quizes. you&#39;re set and done.Wonderful man who is one of the clearest, best, and most interested lecturers I&#39;ve had.  If you know stuff on old quizzes and exams, you&#39;ll do well in the class.  A billion times better than the teacher 2nd semester.Feigenson is the BEST proff in the bio department. He is absolutely caring and his lectures makes you interested in the material. His exams are managable if you study. Great course and proffSparked a genuine interest in BiochemistryExcellent excellent professor.Very friendly and a great speakerhe cares so much about his students! his grading system with dividing your grade by the mean is a little wack tho...it makes it imposs to get a&#39;s on a lot of things!very competent professorBEST SCIENCE PROFESSOR HERE.  I really can&#39;t say enough about how great Prof F was.  He&#39;s so interested in his kids--he even does these Friday sessions where he talks about issues his students are facing (like applying to med school, grad school, doing research, etc) and offers sooo many office hours.  I&#39;m so glad I took this class.Best Professor ever!Prof. Feigenson is an amazing man - very helpful! Go to his office hours because he tries hard to get to know his students. He made it very clear on what things we need to know and not for the test. The second chance policy works really sweet. Previous tests help a lot. Make use of the virtual office hours- TAs explain better that way. SWEET CLASS!Feigenson is fantastic.  You can tell he puts a ton into this class, from the separate word files he creates for the lecture notes to the silly little overheads he prepares and manipulates with forceps.  Great prof.No CommentsI would not be where I was in my life today without Dr F.  I&#39;m now almost done medical school, and his course REALLY helped... and his extra &#39;seminars on life&#39; are very worthwhile:  he gave me a sense of focus and direction again.

The class is an easy A if you keep up with the work, but you honestly should just take the class for the professor. He&#39;s extremely passionate and makes learning oceanography entertaining and manageable.Professor Monger is one of the top 3 professors I&#39;ve had at Cornell. He&#39;s the man.Oceanography with Professor Monger changed my career aspirations entirely. I am now going to pursue a master&#39;s in environmental policy because of how his class inspired me to help protect our Earth from climate change. Even if you just watch the lectures online before the tests (I didn&#39;t attend a single class in person) you will learn something.So kind, really great lecturer, and so passionate about the material! He was very understanding and made the online class accessible and simple with just a few quizzes and an easy final paper.Professor Monger is one of the most passionate professors you&#39;ll have.

Sometimes a little flustered, but only as some of the most intelligent professors often are.This class is one of the best run classes at Cornell. The simutext readings are good exposure to material and the lectures are very very important. The prelims are very predictable and are of appropriate difficulty. Overall, good class and good professorYou don&#39;t need the textbook. All you need to do is attend section and memorize lecture slides and you&#39;ll get a good grade on the pre-lims and final.Grading was very straightforward, this was one of my most organized classes. Homework was reading 1-4 sections of an online textbook with questions embedded. A lot of it was too detailed for tests, though. Tests were more lecture-focused. Lecture notes were posted and Prof Goodale was a good lecturer. Clear office hours and appointments if needed.Reading is important but BIOEE 1610 is an easy intro bio classVery well respected professor. Tests are only on lecture material, though it is necessary to read to understand lecture material. Tests are harder than you think they are going to be. Lectures seem very easy, and then you take the test and are like whaaaa??the best you can get from a runner up of Times person of the year in &#39;06Interesting lectures and a great professor.Class treats you like youre a third grader, demanding no laptops, and interactive activity slides. Like wha?! Annoying quizzes before and after every lecture. Lectures put you to sleep. Even if you answer correctly on the exam, somehow you lost points for not including something the question didnt ask for.For an intro class, he wasn&#39;t accommodating when it came to his lectures. He&#39;d move way too fast between slides, and didn&#39;t allow laptops or any devices to accommodate for his lecturing speed: he&#39;d only say, the lectures are posted online, but they aren&#39;t that helpful anyways. If you don&#39;t read the book or have history with ecology, you&#39;re screwed.Prof. Howarth is cool. He&#39;s been an active participate in climate change related meetings for a long time. So if you&#39;re interested in environmentalism and advocacy, it is cool to listen to his stories. I had a background in ecology before taking the class so the material wasn&#39;t particularly difficult. Read the book and you&#39;ll be fine.Not impressed with teaching ability. Lectures are boring and disorganized. He does not treat students as though they are Ivy League intellectuals. Reads every word on every slide shown in lecture, rather than using slides as a reference or tool for discussion. We can read. We know what your slide says.Not the best best teaching ability - was far from captivating. Voice hard to hear, didn&#39;t use mic well.He dropped the lowest exam which was great; I skipped the final and went home for break early. If you study the lectures you will do well on the tests. The workload is predictable and manageable. I was afraid to take bio as a business major but ended up enjoying the class and getting an A, even though I skipped several lectures.I really liked this professor as a person. His lectures were boring 70% of the time, and I didn&#39;t like the 3 prelims or final. I didn&#39;t feel like it was super clear what we were supposed to be learning. My TA sucked. Overall the class was alright, maybe not for non-science majors.Lectures were a bit bland, but he tried to put in lots of interesting examples to better explain concepts like research cases or planet earth videos. Seems like a nice guy, though.Lot of info to memorize, but easy class otherwiseFletcher gave good lectures and had a good sense of humor.Chill classCourse was lecture and lab. Goodale just was one of the lecture profs and taught pretty decently.coolVery nice, clear instructor. Interesting and kind. I wish he had taught more of my class!Proff. Hairston is a genuinely good standard professor. He teaches exactly why you SHOULD know for the exam. It&#39;s probably not his fault that whoever writes the exams has issues with constructing a clear question. It seems like they give a group of grad students shots of tequila and then make them write the exam from memory, and then no one revisesAnurag&#39;s very appearance and his wonderful mien inspire me to galvanize myself into action, grow a magnificent neckbeard, and go out into the world to explore the uncharted wilderness. He also wears entrancing t-shirts.Excellent lecturer in an intro bio course. Found lectures on monarch butterfly ecology (his area of expertise) fascinating. I thoroughly enjoyed the course, although I wish practice prelims or any sort of exam questions were given. Wish he lectured more than the other professors.Is condescending when students ask questions. When they don&#39;t understand after his unhelpful answer, he doesn&#39;t care and doesn&#39;t bother to help any further.

You can tell he makes an effort for people to be able to learn everything and do well, unlike professors of premed weed-out courses.  Note that some of the things other reviewers are saying on this page don&#39;t refer to him directly - e.g., the museum issue is the course director&#39;s fault.Professor Reed was the head professor when I took BIOEE 1780. He is an overall nice guy, and he is relatively funny, but he can be a bit condescending sometimes when you come to ask him for help. He was an alright professor, but not the best.I loved Professor Lovette! Though sometimes his voice is a little sleep-inducing, he really  knows his stuff. He loves birds and he always says it. Just make sure you really listen in class as well as study the book because the class takes a lot of dedication. Also, I think he is pretty hot, but that&#39;s just me.Super nice, really knows his stuff and has an interest in it, and really takes an interest in his students even in large lecture classes.

His introductory biology class is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, but he teaches really well, has a great, quirky personality, and is helpful during office hours. He really wants his students to learn. Pay very close attention to the PowerPoints, not the textbook.Great speaker; he makes time in lectures fly by. He&#39;s very straightforward, organized, and responsive when it comes to answering questions.He is a fabulous professor; he explains material well and is extremely responsive to questions. The material is interesting and easy to understand, although there is a ton of memorization. However, the prelims are short and do a poor job of assessing subject knowledge. It is extremely difficult to get an A in the class, even if you study a lot.He is an absolutely wonderful professor! He is helpful and his lectures are always interesting. Very open and thoughtful. The one draw back is that the exams are all over the place in what is considered important material. On a side note, I took this course for writing in the majors and it was amazing! Would definitely take a course of his again!Professor Lovette is not only one of the best professors at Cornell, he is one of the kindest people out there. He cares so much for his students and is excited about what he teaches. He keeps class fun with jokes and examples. I would recommend him as a professor, advisor, or anything else! Definitely take this class or any class he teaches!Professor Lovette is great! He cares so much about his students and really puts the time in to help out any student that needs it.

I definitely recommend this class or any class he teaches!Wonderful professor!  He really cares about his students and is readily available to give help or advice.  I would definitely recommend taking any class that he teaches.  Dr Gilbert is by far the funniest and coolest lecturer of 1780. He teaches Animal evolutionary history and is hilarious and one of the few professors for the class that is actually engaging. Very down to earth, very meme worthy. Favorite professor of the semester by far, if only for the pure sass and sarcasm emanating from this man.Hilarious.  The powerpoint slides he makes are very entertaining.  His material in 1780 can be hard because it&#39;s all memorization but he gives lots of interesting examples.  Possibly my favorite of the five 1780 lecturers.Jeremy was great and I loved his shrew jokes and ofc his accent. 1780 is unique with its active learning approach, so there are a lot of in class activities within groups and small grading assignments throughout the year, putting less pressure on prelims. Class was basically memorization. You put in the work and memorize it you get an A.Love this professor! He is honestly invested in his students and wants each of them to succeed. Great sense of humour and makes every class if not fun, then at least tolerable.This course is quite easy for a biology course at Cornell. Prof. Searle is incredibly helpful and nice if you ever go to his office hours. The class has many guest lecturers throughout, which keeps things interesting.

Too bad bio&#39;s in the morning when people can&#39;t stay awake.  The class is tough, but he puts most of the info out there very clearly and then expects you to make the connections.No CommentsHe&#39;s a good professor.  He&#39;s clear with his lectures, tries to explain everything but sometimes loses time.  If you listen to his lectures, take good notes (get good sleep for it), read the book, and do all study questions. You&#39;ll get an A in his class.I thought going into this huge intro class would be intimidating and very hard to learn anything. Wrong! Prof. Walcott is really good, he makes you forget the 100&#39;s of other people and really learn.No CommentsFun teacher, good biology class. Lecture heavy and boring, very hard to get an A, but a B is easy and hes a super cool dudeLectures are VERY general compared to exam questions. Nice hair, though.You guys shoudl stop complaining.  The class is very helpful in that it teaches you how to think critically as a biologist.  This class definitely weeds out all the wannabe premeds and science majors that do not want to spend the time to study the material.Great sense of humor; festoon and human in a half shell are crowd catches. StudyNo CommentsAs an intro level bio class for majors, the class is meant to be difficult and lives up to its reputation. However Cole does a great job in teaching the class. By going to lecutres, keeping up on the readings, and studying difficult material extra the class in manageable. Cole does excellent lectures, has great powerpoints, and is so knowledgeable.Gilbert is AMAZING!!!  I absolutely love this class.  He&#39;s a really dynamic lecturer, and he knows his stuff.  I&#39;m pretty sad that he won&#39;t be teaching 2nd semester intro bio.  The best way I&#39;ve found to study for this class is to take my textbook and highlight\/take notes in it as he lectures...he tends to follow it pretty closely.  He&#39;s great!Dynamic and exciting lectures. He sometimes goes into certain topics too deep, but that&#39;s fine. Prelims can be harder than you think so be prepared. I personally didn&#39;t like his prelims because some questions seemed irrelevant. Yet, overall, Prof.Gilbert is a great guy.I liked how he taught the class with funny jokes and whatnotHis teaching style doesn&#39;t make or break the class - he&#39;s just aite. Ideally, you could look at the ppt slides (&amp; listen to audio if you want to) &amp; skip class &amp; do just fine, but you gotta go for the clicker q&#39;s. Study really hard, you know the rep of intro bio...hottest prof at cornell.  easily!  Lots of work in this class though, but the eye candy made up for it to some extent :)Worse teacher at Cornell University. All he tries to do is fail you and make sure you don&#39;t learn anything. He hates his students and is quite frankly a jerk. He is never available when you need him, not like he would be of any help at all. On top of that, his test are absolute BS and test nothing.Great Professor, great class. But the course is very difficult, designed to weed out pre-meds. Too bad 2004 Spring was his last semester teaching it, it will be hard to follow in his footsteps.3 words to sum him up: BORING AS HELL!!No CommentsWhen a student answers a question (and fails to notice notice the oxygen atoms in the head of a phospholipid), Owens reponds with, &#34;yes, correct... but on the other end, there&#39;s oxygen.  If you READ the text, you would know that.&#34;I went to office hours--rather than answering my question about cellular respiration, he personally attacked me for the poor performance of the class on the previous test (average= 61%).  He made me cry.  I hadn&#39;t cried in about 2 years.No CommentsTom Owens is one of the most useless teachers I have ever had, and I&#39;ve had some weirdos. He insists that he&#39;s teaching us how to apply the functions of biology when he&#39;s really just testing how much humiliation we can stand in one term. He doesn&#39;t care if we learn, he just wants us to suffer!No CommentsDONT DO IT!!! TOMMY O IS A BAD BAD MANI dropped this class because the tests were so ridiculous.  Everyone I know studied for hours and still said they pretty much guessed on every question.  When the class average on your first test is in the 30s or 40s, it&#39;s time to reevaluate the fairness and clarity of the exam.Really difficult exams!! You really have to work hard in this course and think like Owens if you want to do well.He is a rat ****.  He doesnt teach the material, then gives rediculously hard tests.  This man deserves to die a painful deathHis exams were ridiculous-- it had nothing to do with how well you knew the subject matter but how well you could read his mind. He has a major ego complex. He kept saying how other sciences are useless next to bio. I found him really offensive.Absolutely horrid professor.  My friend just graduated a bio major at Yale...he took the 2nd prelim and he got a 69!!!  His tests have nothing to do with what little bit he teaches us in class...If you&#39;re an incoming freshman with AP credit, USE IT!!!  AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!!!Very difficult class!  Weed out class for potential premeds.  Beware~ you have been warned.most people dont like tommy-o. he can be mean and annoying. his tests are hard. he flips out if people talk, or if cell phones ring. his tests are about understanding how he thinks. he loves nothing more than tricking people. he doesnt like teaching this class at all!Tommy O is a devious man! He seeks pleasure from student&#39;s pain! He wants to see you fail! AVOID HIM LIKE THE PLAGUE!Walcott is the cutest old man! It was great to start off bio w\/such a great professor.  Not an easy class, but he made it worthwile.  Too bad he&#39;s retired, but take BioNB 221 if you want to see him guest-lecture.T. Owens is the man! You all need to get a grip. Granted, the tests are ridiculous, but the lectures are amazing.  Maybe the problem is that you fools haven&#39;t actually thought in a while.  Try it some time.Dr. Gilbert is not a good professor...he flies through his powerpoints without taking a breath...it&#39;s impossible to catch hardly any of what he is saying...his tests are unbearably difficult b\/c of the large amount of material he inadequately covers..if you want to pass his class, be prepared to put in lot of extra work teaching yourself everythingworst professor everHis exams are the worst and I don&#39;t think anyone doubts that. However, Professor Owens loves teaching and he can be extremely helpful during office hours. He will respect you for taking the extra time to seek help.Owens is a great professor, but perhaps far too intelligent for most students&#39; tastes. Whenever I struggled, he helped me. I&#39;d recommend him.Makes very hard tests, but is a much better motivator than a lot of professors. Questions are mostly logic based and less detail based. Know the facts and be ready to think on tests. Do all the reading or you&#39;re not gonna get anywhere.He really does get you to think critically and logically like a biologist. If you don&#39;t do well in his intro course, it means that you&#39;re not thinking scientifically.No Commentsattend every lecture, thank god he cut his hairDon&#39;t ever, ever miss a lecture!No CommentsNo CommentsProf Owens is just as good as any other Bio prof I have had. I never thought he was arrogant or put people down. He seemed to care how well we did. Also he didn&#39;t ask questions on meaningless details like the second semester guy did.Tommy O might have taught concepts and the big picture but he was not a pleasant person ( his ego filled Uris Auditorium) and was not helpful if you struggled...His office hours were a joke. Turgeon was such a better prof. than T.O. Go Turgeon!He was a very hard professor and right after exams, he&#39;d have a smug look on his face, knowing he&#39;s ruining so many students&#39; lives.most egotistical professor i encountered during my time at cornell","difficulty":3.9215686275,"rating":2.6666666667},{"index":952,"prof_name":"Cole Gilbert","prof_dept":"Biology","class_name":"BIOG1011","comment":"Kool dude.

The fact is, Turgeon might be nice but I think he really slacked at his teaching job.

I didn&#39;t have much interaction with Sacco, but when I did he was helpfThis class was hard and time consuming.the deadlines keep you on track, but some of the information they test is irrelevant and highly specific.  if you fall behind, you&#39;re screwed.At first Tyson seemed helpful; other times very uninterested in students. the rare lectures are boring and pointless.This class is all syntax, no semantics! Strict memorization, contrary to what they say. Also, I think they believe it is the only\/ only important class in a student&#39;s schedule because it takes up way too much time. They really don&#39;t have accurate judgment of how much time this class takes.As much as this class was a real drag and source of stress, probably more than other classes, I definitely learned the material. And Tyson is incredibly nice and willing to help if you seek him out. Don&#39;t take the class if you can&#39;t manage your time though - that&#39;s one of the biggest challenges.Lots of work, tests, stress. No major prelims though. Hard, in-depth labs, but not every week.

But in the last couple weeks when I was really struggling, I sought him out and he was really helpful, understanding, and tried to calm me down when I was stressed.He&#39;s so hot, took the class last year and flunked it, but that aside, what you put into the course is what you&#39;ll get, DON&#39;T FALL BEHIND, and the weekly oral tests really do force you to learn the material, which is good (if you live, of course).stay away from this horrible class!!!!!!!!!!! worst class at cornell that i&#39;ve taken so far and i&#39;m GRADUATING next semester. grading is not so sweet either, but this class alone will ruin your semester.. professor is &#34;there&#34; but not really helpful when you have tons of studying to do all on your own. i learned so much, but it comes up later anywayTyson Sacco?

He is the worst professor\/teacher I have ever had, including my angry art teacher in third grade.  His tests are in no way related to his god-awful lectures.  Highlight of the class: Randy&#39;s video of a guy farting to classical music to teach us about digestion.Take his class if you enjoy reading 150 lectures slides in 50 min.  He skips half of the slides and then puts the information on the prelim after he tells you it wont be on there.He is an aweful professor. Avoid his class.His class is easy, the exam doesn&#39;t really expect much memorization. He&#39;s very friendly and helpful too. Interesting way of teaching, though some people do find it boring and useless.This professor was horrible.  We learned nothing but full page quotes in lectures, and he thought we could learn through listening to songs and watching a guy fart in a video.  Even worse, his tests were incredibly unpredictable and the final was nothing like everyone expected.Terrible.Nice guy, but despite the cool British accent, lectures are really boring and at 9 in the morning! Luckily, you can get by without going to class if you read the lecture notes and the textbook. Tests aren&#39;t bad.He does have a different teaching style that can be annoying at first, BUT the prelims were straight from his lecture slides and he took 90% of the Qs from the practice prelims. If you went to office hrs he practically told you which Qs would be on the exam. The material itself is easy. Genuinely nice guy who cares about his students.Prof. Davies is a good guy. He wants his students to do well and helps them do so. The class is not that difficult, in fact many of the prelims are just repeated things from old prelims. Just understand thoroughly the study guide he puts out and there is no need for reading the book and stuff like that.Prof Davies Rocks My Socks!Really nice guy.  Willing to do anything to help his students.  Not a great lecturer, but bearable.Here&#39;s a professor who does EVERYTHING he can to help his students -- videotapes the lectures, puts his powerpoints online, gives you all the material, EVERYTHING. Labs were interesting. Lectures were boring, but it&#39;s a 100 level class--if you need a more advanced class, take a more advanced class!ickA lot of people absolutely despise Randy&#39;s way of teaching. It is very different, and was very frustrating for me at first... but having talked to Randy outside of class, I understood his approach a lot better, and I think he&#39;s genuinely a great guy. Not a typical class, but not a difficult one... very similar to how BioG109 was structuredClass itself is fairly easy. Lectures are pointless. Don&#39;t take this class if you&#39;re actually hoping to learn anything about biology.I LOVE RANDY! He is really great. He knows that everyone in  the class is only in it because of requirements so he teaches Bio as if its History. He uses great anecdotes, REALLY cares about the students, and gives a large amount of review materials. He is super approachable and his lecture slides are pretty much all you need for the exams.Terrible professor.  Unclear, unhelpful, waste of time and money. Absolutely terrible.Ok class.  Lectures were long and boring.Let me first say: I hate bio.  Randy did an excellent job to make a subject I hated interesting and worth going to lecture for, even if lecture was at 9 in the morning.  He was extremely hepful, answering all e-mails, and providing so many resources for the prelims and final, that the student really has no excuse to get lower than a B.Randy is one of the nicest professors at Cornell!  He really cares about his students doing well. Its for non majors so he tries to apply the material through mediums that are more interesting to his students. His lectures are boring but its if you do the review questions and study guide its an easy A.Although this class can be boring at times, it&#39;s definitely worth it. It&#39;s an easy A; the man gives you 90% of the test questions beforehand!

His tests are reasonable, but definitely require students to prepare thoroughly.

He does not put up guide questions before lectures, and rants on and on about other things not related to biology.He is a necessary evil. He does what intro bio is designed to do- weed out those who are not cut out for the premed track.

If you fall behind, back sure you talk to her about getting back on track or your grade WILL NOT reflect the incredible amount of work you put into the course!!! Not a great class for freshman who don&#39;t have time management skills yet...Professor Campbell is super nice, but DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I spent at least five hours a day every single day studying for this class. There are really hard oral tests every week, which are extremely stressful for anyone with testing anxiety (like me). I love biology, but this class is just too intense.This class is jokingly easy and you learn a surprising amount of info. You have to actually spend time reading every week and summarising notes and memorizing key concepts, but the main thing that makes this class doable is the fact that if you put in those 5-6 hours every week you will do extremely well. The only bad thing is the tough graded labsThis class is an almost impossible amount of work when coupled with other classes. There are required tests every week so there&#39;s a constant cycle of stress. You absolutely have to read the text book and teach yourself everything. Lectures are boring but flock sessions are helpful. The labs are also a pain and so are dissections.Very doable class if you can read every week. Basically it comes down to memorizing a chapter or two of information each week, and if your good at memorizing the class will be easy and if your not it&#39;ll be hard. A huge component is scientific writing, so if you know you&#39;ll struggle writing research papers\/lab reports don&#39;t even try taking it.People who think 1105 is super hard are just dumb or lazy, 5 hrs\/week (not counting the 4 labs) should get you at least an A-. There&#39;s no real lectures so I think 5 hrs is reasonable enough. However many ppl I met found 1105 super hard... You have to like knowing precise facts and reading textbooks to do well, I guess.","difficulty":3.5714285714,"rating":4.1428571429},{"index":969,"prof_name":"Darlene Campbell","prof_dept":"Biology","class_name":"BIOG1106","comment":"Since it&#39;s an autotutorial class, you don&#39;t have much interaction with Dr. Campbell on a regular basis but she holds office hours every day.

Exams test somewhat niche\/trivial info that isn&#39;t impossible to pick up but requires you to actually read the textbook (helps if you&#39;ve already taken AP Bio).In hindsight, I should not have taken his class. His quizzes were completely random, and how most people did on them was based more on their ability to correctly predict what random questions he would ask than it was how well they knew the important content. Lectures were boring as well, although he did try to make them interesting.Not a very hard class but by no means is super easy. Helpful to have a pretty ok background in bioHe&#39;s funny and nice, a little boring in lecture but very understanding in general. Show up to class b\/c of clicker questions, just take note of what is on the slides because you can get all the details from the textbook. Quizzes (prelims) are graded easy and there&#39;s hardly any other assignments.Very few graded assignments so you must do good on the 2 midterms and final. Exam questions seem random and are difficult to study for. Lectures are very dry and boring and do not relate to the reading in the text book. Make sure you keep up with your textbook reading.Really a great guy. Professor Turgeon&#39;s just a cute little old man, but not the best lecturer. Class was decently difficult, but you get out what you put into it. I just really wish he was my grandpa instead of my professor.Super nice guy!He&#39;s a really nice guy, but his lectures were incredibly boring- everyone had trouble staying awake! You didn&#39;t need to go to lecture b\/c he posted detailed PP online. Sections weren&#39;t relevant to lecture, but they were easy. His quizzes\/test were a bit tricky, especially with multiple choice wording. Class wasn&#39;t bad, just boringgg!Prof. Scanlon is amazing! His lectures are as easy to understand as biology lectures can be, and really wants his students to succeed.Teacher is a cool guy and the class is pretty straight forward.

Read the text, participated in study group, + attended some office hours, still got killed by T\/F exams. :( Take this in the spring, or take a BIOEE instead!!!Good professor. Occasionally his speech is boring because he tends to talk slowly, but he&#39;s passionate and compassionate. I enjoyed taking 1440. Also, learning about plants helped me understand the physiology of life better. No need to buy the text.Dr. Silva is the the most compassionate professor; he really cares about each and every one of his students. He really is passionate about plant biology, and tends to give the more plant based lectures of this class. A lot of bio intro classes ignore plant biology all together, so this class really tried to stress it. Would definitely take again!A very solid class for physiologyEasily the worst professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell.Booker&#39;s inability to give a lecture without trying to be &#34;cool&#34; is as irritating as his inability to draft comprehensible exam questions. Prelims are not about understanding material, but about trying to ascertain what he&#39;s attempting to ask in his misguided and poorly-worded questions. In office hours he is condescending without needing to be.His subject material is a lot tougher than Seely&#39;s for this class but he seems to do a reasonable job of presenting it.  He comes across as a little brusque sometimes but I think it&#39;s all in fun.  He&#39;s pretty funny sometimes.You think you substantially know the material but it doesn&#39;t really help when you&#39;re taking a prelim. The truefalse tests are incredibly difficult and make you feel bad about yourself. Attend Owen&#39;s office hours if you want to receive a satisfactory grade. Take this in the Spring!Professor Booker&#39;s teaching style is more annoying than helpful...his tactics to make students pay attention in class ultimately led to distraction. He knows what he&#39;s talking about, just doesn&#39;t convey it well. The material is pretty straightforward, but the test questions are not very well written.This class is quite interesting but tough on non bio majors. The course goes quite in depth which requires a lot of memorization. Overall a very interesting class for premeds.Cannot keep his focus. He values showing off more than actual teaching. Never gives you a straight answer to without arrogant, useless, and irrelevant sophistry. Took another of his class too, it was the same thing. Arrogance coupled with the inability to keep his mind on a topic consistently for 5 minutes. A peasized brain not suited for the job.The exams are super hard. The trick to the class is attending his office hours. According a vast majority of the students I know, that&#39;s where he bases his Prelim questions on.He stresses what he thinks are important. He words questions so poorly on exams. He shouldn&#39;t teach. Pretty much the worst professor I ever had in my life.Very smart person and expects you to be just as smart. his t\/f exams are tricky and requires you to know the txtbk material VERY well and then APPLY them to the situation. go to office hours and listen even if you dont have questions. go to lectures and take notes on what he says. He is pretty condescending when explaining an answer to a question..He claims that he&#39;s a biologist but he doesn&#39;t know his material at all. How is he a professor? Students know more about biology than he does. It&#39;s a shame that Cornell has a professor like him.He doesn&#39;t even seem to know his material. He&#39;s so focused on trying to keep students awake and making jokes that it&#39;s distracting. One of the most annoying professors.You have to think like him to do well in the class. It&#39;s probably better to take it as a sophomore (after you take cell biology BIOMG 1350 as a freshman). His exams are pretty confusing and might not measure how much you studied. If you want to stick with the class, go to his office hours!!! This is the ticket to not failing!Boring. Hard to listen to.Booker made learning fun and entertaining. He was helpful during office hours, and the students who went to OH regularly did better in his class. Just make sure to understand the concepts and review until you do. Ask about stuff you find confusing and you\u2019ll remember it better. Questions will ask indirectly about the material.&#34;My thinking questions are the type of evaluations you can expect on the MCAT&#34;. No Prof Owens, Ive taken the MCAT and can attest that memorization is far more valued than your method of TF grading which serves to primarily induce stress, confusion, and skewed expectations for premeds. Still must admit, he is very commited to teaching vital conceptsHis lectures are really monotone and boring. The only thing fascinating about his lectures was the way he said &#34;fructose&#34;. One positive is that he made the material applicable to bio majors, especially in the context of disease and disorders.Owens is a great lecturer and knows the material well, but his prelims test how much you&#39;re able to think like him, rather than how much of the material you know. The best thing about him is that he lets you re-take each test with your study group for extra credit. This is the best way to understand your mistakes in this class. As a lecturer, he&#39;s sort of confusing and has SO MANY typos in his powerpoints. He&#39;s funny and all, but I had to read the textbook to get clarification. He doesn&#39;t really respond to e-mails either.T.O. IZ DA MAN.Tom Owens should not be teaching and is the most insensitive professor I have ever met at Cornell. This class was ridiculously hard and he was no help if you were struggling.Knows his material and is obviously knowledgable, but he seems moronic sometimes (he makes mistakes during lectures and gets confused, gets angry at students who simply do not understand, and makes multiple grading errors). But he DOES care about students, and is very helpful about course advice and the like. Not bad.Go to office hours - they really help!Peple don&#39;t like him bc his exams are gpa killers, but he is a fantastic instructor and he opens up to you in office hours if you show a genuine interest in the class.This dude is mad smart and I think he has difficulty conveying all of what&#39;s in his head. The prelims are tricky, but they make for really good discussion. Your study group will carry you, but you better know your material and how to manipulate it.Worst professor ever. ruins your gpa. never take his classes.He cares more about finishing his lecture than presenting it in an understandable manner. So the material becomes confusing and he&#39;s not very approachable for help. Almost as if he doesn&#39;t care about the students.He knows his stuff and is a fairly good lecturer. however, the tests are impossible.Good guy, very smart and cares a lot about the material. Lecture are helpful but personally I wouldn&#39;t go to them if he didn&#39;t take attendance through those mini (ungraded) quizzes. Tests are east once you get the hang of them, but it may take one or two prelims to do so. The best way to study is not to just memorize but to understand the material.Owens is a great lecturer. The way he presents Biology is very clear, connecting previous topics, allowing the student to gain deeper insight by seeing the &#34;big picture.&#34; His office hours are a must, as he highlights important material, sure to pop up on the exam! After taking this course, I know that I have a deeper understanding of Biology.He is an amazing professor who is always there for his students. He truly cares and his office hours are extremely helpful. People who dislike him just don&#39;t utilize all the help he offers. He says it himself this is not a memorization courseWorst class I ever chose to take.  The class is more of an exercise in proving the textbook wrong than it is understanding material.  The tests were all truefalse and completely destroyed everyone grade-wise.  DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!  Here&#39;s the deal: If you&#39;re the type of person who has gotten by so far in life by memorizing text books then this class isn&#39;t for you. Ownens asks questions that require you to have a deep understanding of the material beyond the simple facts. They are difficult, but fair. This man is the definition of vague. He doesn&#39;t answer questions, but instead asks YOU questions so that you figure out the answer by yourself. Too many times he has to throw out a test question because it doesn&#39;t make sense or it&#39;s too wordy or vague. Doesn&#39;t test you on facts, but rather on the &#34;big pictures&#34;.His slides can be a little dense but overall informative. Unfortunately, he can be a little monotone and his lectures are therefore boring.Lectures are very interesting, but do not correlate with test questions. His questions are poorly worded making them nearly impossible to answer. Take this course 2nd semester.Overall you learn very little in this class.  His goal is to make you use critical thinking to answer questions, but in the end his teaching style means that you don&#39;t end up learning much about biology.  His office hours are very helpful, but he tends to tear apart the people who ask questions.  The class also has a harsh curve, all tests are T\/F.If you&#39;re looking for an intro biology class to take, I&#39;d take one where your grade is not based on wordy truefalse confusing tests! Maybe I would take again as a sophomore, but disastrous first &#34;science&#34; course at Cornell!So vague, when asking questions he gives vague answers\/&#34;big picture&#34; yet some of his test questions are so specific. Try to take this class in the Spring!Great class. But the curving really makes it difficult to get an A.He is a great professor who really cares about his students and tries hard to let you LEARN and think. I went to his office hours every week and he makes sure you don&#39;t leave his office confused. You do have to put in the effort too, however. He curves the class nicely, and wants people to do well. Tests are fair: work in=work out.Dr. Buchon is a great professor and really cares about his students and the subject material. Very easy to understand and available for extra help during office hours. I went every week. He is passionate about physiology and you will learn a lot from him. I wish I could take more courses with him!Took BIOG1440 with Buchon, Shapleigh, and Selveraj in FA 2020. Class had both synchronous and asynchronous lecture components. Buchon&#39;s slides and lectures were by far the most comprehensive and he emphasized topics that were likely to be tested. Compared to the other two professors Buchon was by far the best.The course itself is difficult but Buchon explains things in a very clear and understandable way. He does have an accent that can be heavy at times, but his way of teaching is greatThere were 3 instructors for this class and they were really uneven. The body physiology is really the coolest part. Advice: go to office hours!I am very thankful for this professor&#39;s time. He hold something like 10 extra office hours sessions before prelim and these really help.Professor Buchon had very good powerpoints, but his thick French accent sometimes made it difficult to understand him. BIOG 1440 itself is difficult and very memorization heavy, but I think he explained concepts well.I took that class as an external student. The content was very interesting, and challenging. I really appreciated the feedback from the Professor, who answered all my questions quickly.Fantastic professor. He made some complicated subjects feel quite simple!I loved the lecture of Professor Buchon on how microbes influence physiology. Coolest lecture ever. It made me think a lot.I loved that class. But it was clearly the toughest since I started at Cornell !He was sooo helpful during review sessions!!!The lectures are amazing. I consider changing major and taking more biology because of this class.He&#39;s amazing! If you put your all into his classes you will be rewarded. Yes it will be the hardest class of your life but you will not regret a single moment- be sure to take advantage of office hours and ask questions!This professor really helped me organize to study for my exams. In addition, he took ample time to explain the material even after exams, or to explain what I was missing in my exam. This class is my last requirement and this helped a lot!Dr Buchon was very helpful during the semester. I started with a bad score during my first prelim, but thanks to TAs and Professors&#39; office hours, I kept increasing my score. Dr Buchon advices were really helpfulThe material is difficult but presented very clearly. Exams are fair; but you better go to review sessions. This professor is very accessible, he will spend time with you until you understand things. There is a lot of information so better study from the start. Thankfully the final is not cumulative.Great introduction to physiology. Has been recommended to me by my academic mentor as a premed. This course is very time-consuming course but also very rewarding and practical to understand human physiology.Great teacher. Loved it!Fantastic professor. He makes everything clear !Wonderful prof!  He&#39;s very calm which is I guess that&#39;s why people fall asleep and he&#39;s good at explaining things.  He also has a charming sense of humor and tells interesting relevant anecdotes (the story about maple syrup....)I actually loved BioG1440 and especially the section taught by Buchon. The exams were very fair, you really just have to listen to what he says in class. The other instructors were a bit less clear, but overall a good class. Exams come one day apart from chem, this was tough.Dr Buchon explained everything we needed to know very clearly and plainly. I was glad to get to study from himDON&#39;T EVER TAKE HIS CLASSES!!! always gave us recorded lectures for an hour straight (some of them were even 1hr20min long) but he still couldn&#39;t explain things clearly. Lectures were real boring and made me fall asleep. The concepts of the class were not bad tho, just the profs.Lecture slides unclear - not enough text, just some pictures. Glosses over some phrases that are key to understanding difficult concepts.Professor Selvaraj really tried to explain neurons. His powerpoints unfortunately were a bit sparse and the concepts themselves were extremely difficult. As BIOG 1440 is a memorization heavy class, it was difficult, but he made very useful study sheets and was clear about what he expected from students.I think this was the first time Prof Selvaraj was teaching 1440. His slides contained almost no information, and he overcomplicated his lectures by adding material outside the scope. He also mumbled and talked very softly while lecturing which made him hard to understand.He didn&#39;t get everyone falling asleep in class, but that DOESN&#39;T MEAN he was a good professor. Lecture content was VERY different from test material, and the class WAS NOT curved. The average was supposed to be a C, but he widened the bins so everyone got a B-. Then the very last day of grading, he changed half the grades due to math error. RUN.Nice guy,but if you are not that interesting in comparative physiology or bio- this is not the class for you. teaches class w another professor; he loves plants and is very helpful. YOU NEED TO SHOW up to class because the book over explains. the tests are hard, but easier than they were in past years. lots of TF &amp; multiple choice. record lectures!So much better than Booker! And he&#39;s funny. He&#39;s very clear and keeps students engaged. Great professor!Easy. All the material is in both the textbook and lectures. Go to office hours and he will basically tell you the questions and answers on exams.Prof. Gilbert was great! He tried to be as interesting as you can with this material. His lectures were clear and simple, and he showed genuine interest in our understanding the subject and being prepared for the exams. Oh, and sometimes he&#39;d randomly run around to make a point. Cool guy!This is one professor who actually seems like a genuinely nice guy who cares about the students. Encourages everyone to get to know him in office hours.

TAs are very helpful with tutoring and Dr. Campbell is super caring and helpful when anyone needs help. If you are good at pacing yourself and are passionate about physiology, 1445 is for you!Very work intensive. I recommend taking BIOG1045 to supplement. Do not take as a freshman. You will spend at least 20 hours per week for this class. Professor does not make this class any easier and is 100% run by TAs.Seriously tough class, and you really need to work for your grade. You learn a lot, which can be a good thing depending on where you stand. I would say it&#39;s worth it if you&#39;re really into biology, but otherwise you&#39;re wasting time learning a lot of material.

Dr. Campbell is very nice, approachable, and available, but you have more interaction with the TAs. The class itself is demanding, but all the test material comes right from the objectives.

Dr. Campbell is the most amazing professor I have ever had, I am lucky enough to be working with her again. I would definitely push other students to take this course.Dr. Campbell is a really kindnice professor. You won&#39;t really interact  with her though; most of the time the students learn from the TAs, reading the textbook and answering the questions in the Survival Guide.

All in all, the class is fairly easy and straightforward (if you have a good TA).He seems like a good professor overall.  The class, on the other hand....Very helpful man, lectures were clear and entertaining. Really nice guy if you ever go to office hours.Sarvary&#39;s lectures are easy to understand, and the material is really simple. If you have a good TA, this class is a piece of cake.The online book is fairly useless as a study tool. However, you will need it for prelecture and during lecture questions. Expect the TAs to have different approaches to grading and handing out studymaterial that is allowed and not allowed. The course staff decided not to hand out study guides, practice prelims, and answer keys to homework problems.I would second the disorganized comment. Lectures too seem useless. This class is incredibly dull. It is taught at a Kindergarten pace and your experience really relies on your TA. Sarvary himself is boring, arrogant, and patronizing. I hated this class and the only reason I ever went was for participation points.Super easy A but one of the most boring classes I&#39;ve ever taken. The material is extremely simple, but it takes so much time to get through. Prof Sarvary himself is kind, lenient when you need an extension and overall cares about the course.The lectures were early and mandatory; I would get breakfast and eat it during lecture because there was nothing of value being spoken most of the time. However, there were clicker questions to make sure we were there. The labs were slow and were very easy, so just show up, stay for 3 hours a week, and you&#39;ll get an A.Don&#39;t buy the online textbook, as everyone else said. Get the free trial. Overall, this is a fairly easy class; it was my favorite, because the labs were pretty interesting and there was a light course load. Definitely answer poll everywhere questions, and find some good people for lab partners since you&#39;ll be stuck with them for most classes!BIOG 1500 was an excellent foundational course. Dr. Sarvary is a great adviser!Sarvary is a quality guy, but lectures are useless (but mandatory) and labs are unnecessarily long and tedious. The lab skills are relevant and applicable to research, but the course is paced at 1 mph. Overall, the workload is negligible and the course is an easy A so long as you put in minimal effort.You don&#39;t need to buy the online textbook or go to lecture other than for Poll Questions.good guy. But hated his tests and hated his lab course. His lectures are clear tho.Go to lecture to answer questions to receive credit. Lab is not difficult. Prepare for lab practicals. Take class with people you know because lab gets boring and there is a group project.Learned a lot in lab and became more confident in my research skills, but she is too strict, especially on those research papers.

And his tests are usually take home essays, which I think is awesome!Brilliant professor. I had a bad AP bio teacher in hs and Prof. Owens helped me big time. Highly recommended.Awesome!!!!He&#39;s a great professor. Keep in mind many of these comments are criticizing Introductory Biology, a terrible course.

Definitely wants to communicate to his students well. Looks like Mark Twain a bit, but with a nice compact body (and what a butt).amazing professor. incredibly clear. always helpful if have any questions.Ross was great. If you don&#39;t understand something, take the initiative to go to his office. He will remember your name for the rest of the course, and talk to you during class. Gives breaks during long lectures. Go to Nero&#39;s review sessions--they are key!Excellent professor!  His lectures are well-planned and organized.  The material is complicated, but he does a good job of explaining things.  It is impressive that he can make this subject interesting!  I would definitely recommend taking genetics with Dr. Fox.  Of course, the class itself is a pain, so better to not take it at all!Great professor! His lectures are very enjoyable and easy to follow.  Make sure to take genetics in spring with Professor Fox!sack of****No CommentsLectures were interesting\/engaging most of the time... toward the end of the semester they became somewhat erratic and hard to follow. Overall, a very nice guy, very helpful if you ever see him around. Definitely do the hw problems!Awesome guy.  Hard exams! Very smart. I hear he&#39;s better than other genetics professors.BEST TEACHER AT CORNELL! Lectures are always clear, he is incredibly helpful to meet with and always available- great to talk to about stuff other than genetics too!No CommentsVery thorough, engaging lecturer. Concerned with what students think, encourages questions. Extremely approachable during the lecture break, before, after and during OH. Thoughtful and understanding as well. If you need to take genetics, Spring is a good time! Plus, he&#39;s a yeast dude, unlike the Fall guy which is a Drosophila dude.This class is difficult but interesting if you like biology. Fox is a good lecturer, very clear and helpful. He is an all-around nice guy and kept me awake and interested through a long lecture.He&#39;s a great lecturer. Lab is the real killer, not the lecture. Take this class in the spring not fall, the fall professor is horrible.Very knowledgable, but he never repeated important points. A no-no in genetics.i actually loved this class, but Goldberg was terrible.I took his class many years ago and I remember him as the ABSOLUTE WORST Cornell Prof I ever had.  He is pompous, cannot effectively convey any of the concepts, and is entirely demeaning to his students.  The mean on his first exam was 24 (out of 100).by far the worst course i have ever taken.  even the takenotes didnt make sense.No CommentsNo CommentsI would rather stick a fork in my eye than take this class again.Tom Fox is an excellent professor. His lectures are very clear and interesting, and it is surprisingly easy to stay awake for the two hour lecture. The lab, however, is far from enjoyable.The class is pointless. all stuff we&#39;ve learned in other classes, mainly Intro Bio. Lab&#39;s the killer. a violation of our constitutional rights in how many hours and days of lab work it requires. doesn&#39;t respect the religious sabbath. write a letter!!!Yes, it may not be the easiest class, but to be honest I had a LOT more trouble with orgo.  I find the class interesting, and Fox is a great guy-easy to talk to about anything, real down to Earth.  I like his lectures.The course subject is difficult, but I think Fox did a good job of teaching it.  He&#39;s one of the better lecturers I&#39;ve had: speaks and writes on the board at just the right pace, so I usually don&#39;t have trouble with taking notes.Fly with the hippiesThis was the absolutely worst class I&#39;ve had at Cornell.  He was mean, cruel, and absolutely useless!Profesor is extremely out of touch with the material on the exam. If you want to do well in the lecture part of the course go to all the Problem Sovling Sessions and do those problems. You should be fine. Lab is a ton of work. If you&#39;re interested in the material great class, otherwise stay away.Hey Guys, c&#39;mon, FOX is a nice guy. The lectures could be a little bit more structured and follow the test more. But, wow, you really get to appreciate Fox when Macentire came in a did a lecture. Fox was like 500 times better!This class is definitely difficult, but interesting and practical. Fox is a good lecturer- a little unorganized but tons better than Macintyre. Lab is a pain, problem solving is helpful. Tests really aren&#39;t that bad but you have to put LOTS of time into this course. Don&#39;t fall behind!!!!!This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.he is smart, and just because you are incompetent you should not be critical toward him.From a guy who originally thought that Drosophila had 4 wings, he has no business making us suffer through the fly lab!Boring, redundant, and unclearthe class just sucks.  debbie should teachHe is very confusing and not helpful when you ask questions!  Debbie should give the lectures!Mac&#39;s a nice guys and a pretty clear lecturer; gives breaks during class; knows his stuff. Nonetheless, Debbie Nero is better.Macintyre is an average professor. He&#39;s not particularly open or receptive, and i don&#39;t blame him with so many hardcore premeds in the class.The people who do talk to him a lot are oblivious to how much they annoy him, and these are the same suck-ups who think mac actually likes them.HORRIBLEHe&#39;s obviously a genius in Genetics. It&#39;s amazing the depth with which he knows the material, even for a professor and a researcher. But as a professor he expected the students to follow too much too quickly. He&#39;s one of those people that proves the saying that the smartest people don&#39;t always make the best teachers. Debbie Nero helped a lot.He is very nice and willing to help if you approach him. Although the course material is hard and a lot of work he is a nice guy and a genius in genetics! If you don&#39;t understand something, ask questions because he doesn&#39;t mind going over it again. The textbook is helpful.Ross is awesome, and he is really helpful if you come to his office hours. Despite the difficulty of this class, I actually enjoyed the lectures.The breaks in lecture are great and he often lets class out early.  However, this class is still a ton and a half of work. He sometimes doesn&#39;t emphasize the main point you are supposed to be getting out of his examples.Class was really difficult, long nights preparing for this course. Almost the most difficult course I have ever taken at Cornell. Course can be very time consuming if you want to do well. The bad rumors surrounding it are true, lab sucks. Flies take longgg time to count while bacteria concepts are hard to understand! Take early &amp; don&#39;t suffer late!He&#39;s a nice guy and he&#39;s obviously a genius in his field. However he assumes you understand everything and forgets this is an intro class, not a graduate study. His office hours were impossible. Debbie was a lot more helpful.Genetics at Cornell IS everything that it is made out to be.  The amount of work is absolutely incredible.  In the next three weeks, there are a total of 6 lab reports due (3 on flies, 3 on bacteria) to go along with lecture material and an exam!","difficulty":3.9565217391,"rating":3.0869565217},{"index":988,"prof_name":"Michael Goldberg","prof_dept":"Biology","class_name":"BIOGD2810","comment":"This class was extremely interesting and due to the high level of detail that we are required to know the material, it makes the Genetics questions on the MCAT seem quite simple, which is good!

Tests are very specific and difficult. My tips: pay attention to wording on tests - the answer is almost never all of the above; memorize EVERYTHING on summary pages; use quizlet\/flashcards for little details because they WILL be asked. No need to really read textbook.She words all of her prelims in such ambiguous terms that you cannot differentiate answers and figure out which is correct. Moreover, there are so many questions on obscure examples that are mentioned on a single slide that feel incredibly unimportant to the course. Most questions come with a &#34;none of the above&#34; and &#34;all of the above.&#34;Can be disorganized, but is a kind person that is passionate about her topics. Prelims were sometimes worded weirdly with trick questions. Her accent is very understandable. Like everyone else says, you should study all the little details if you want to do well.1350 was my favorite class of freshman year. The material is fascinating and extremely relevant. It&#39;s clear that Maria cares a lot about the class and her students. She is passionate and knowledgeable, but can be unclear and disorganized. Pay close attention in class, review notes, and study EVERYTHING, as prelims are challenging but fair game.Absolutely tedious class. The material feels pointless at times, probably because we don&#39;t know much about developmental biology, so pretty much everything she teaches needs to be memorized. Also, her prelim questions are notoriously memorization-based and worded awfully. You need to think like she does to get her exam questions right.She is kind, but her lectures were bad. Her accent is difficult to understand. Additionally, her material was unorganized and did not follow a logical progression between lectures. The prelim asked some peculiar questions but was mostly an accurate representation of lecture summaries.Hard to understand at times due to a thick accent. Delivers material in a way that is challenging to internalize quickly. Office hours are helpful but sometimes goes too in depth and confuses students more. Kind woman but just a mediocre professor. Her portions of the prelims are incredibly challenging and specific. To succeed, memorize everything.Topics are interesting, but extremely detailed prelims forcing harsh memorization. Relatively low prelim scores, but gets curved to a b-\/bHard to understand due to her disorganized and confusing lectures.  Going to office hours didn&#39;t help either, she seemed confused about her own subject.  Her i clicker questions were difficult confusing and often omitted vital information that should have been provided.  The night before the exam she sent an email out clarifying a mistake she made.Really interesting content but horrible lecturing. Very convoluted progression. Iclickers are wordy and hard to understand. Sometimes the TAs don&#39;t even understand.Everyone gets on her case for being hard to understand, but I didn&#39;t have much of a problem with her.  She is really nice and she is in love with the subject she teaches, and I found her optimism infectious.  I definitely thought she was a good professor.I only had Kelly once everything switched to online, but given the circumstances I think she did well. She explained concepts well and her powerpoints were clear. BIOMG 1350 is a memorization heavy class so it&#39;s difficult, but she was very accessible if a student had questions.Really great professor! I took the course online and I had heard the course was difficult. Dr. J made learning the material really enjoyable.Very nice professor. Willing to answer questions and wants you to do well. Explains concepts well.Dr. Garcia was easily one of the smartest professors I&#39;ve had at Cornell. She is extremely helpful if you approach her outside of class and will go out of her way to explain something in detail. The class is very challenging to do very well in, but it is doable.Professor Jesch was organized and prepared. He really wants students to succeed and learn something new. His class made me want to take more biology. If you are struggling, go to his office hours and he will always try to help you out in different ways if he knows you&#39;re trying your best.She leaned too heavily on her slides and made the class boring and irrelevant. Her tests were a nightmare because you had to memorize every minute detail on her slides.

When times got tough, he was there to listen to me. DO ALL THE TEXTBOOK QUESTIONS!Difficult class, but good professorCompletely worthless and inarticulate as a lecturer. Definitely skip lectures and just learn from the book. Most of her lecture is just her saying &#34;You should read about this in the textbook, so I&#39;m not going to explain it&#34; anyway. Really pathetic.Great professor definitely one of the more difficult courses at Cornell and hard work is necessary, but Fox is a genuinely enjoyable teacher who makes the best of it. Fox is also extremely knowledgeable and always available to talk.Challenging but overall very interesting class, important to go to lectures because he tests on that material, the textbook is good for supplementing lectures and practice questions. Dr. Fox is very friendly and approachable, and goes out of his way to help out.My favorite prof. He&#39;s a really great guy, very human and down to earth. Really good at explaining complicated genetics stuff. I would take any class with him at the helm.This was the hardest class I&#39;ve taken but it was very rewarding. Dr. Fox is so nice and his lectures are great. Btw this class is NOT memorization heavy. MY TIPS: Do all the tb practice problems! And never skip lecture bc he teaches stuff that isnt in the tb. Also OH are very helpful (Dr. Blake is great too!)Dr. Fox is very willing to help and interested in helping his students. The class has a bit of a bad rap, but taking it with Dr. Fox is really not bad.Fox is a great guy who makes genetics interesting by teaching beyond the book. The course is probably the most demanding one I&#39;ve taken at Cornell. Do EVERY SINGLE ASSIGNED TEXTBOOK PROBLEM to prepare for exams. Exams are difficult and the partial credit is abysmal. Go to every lecture; some things he mentions are not in the book but still tested.Great professor, would highly recommend this class. Some students find the material dry, but everyone agrees that Fox does the best he can with the material and tends to deliver engaging lectures. Big on problem solving, not memorization: you really don&#39;t need to memorize anything. Go to the problem solving sessions!!Take Genetics with Fox! By far the best.

Goldberg comes off as arrogant when you go to his office hours which doesn&#39;t help a struggling student.This course is structured poorly and will discourage you, there is a never-ending flow of problem sets and readings, your questions require OH yet the TAs  have so little time fore you that questions go unanswered.

The auto-tutorial format is well suited because biochem in general is memorization heavy. Jim is available to answer questions, and he has a great teaching team to help out. His review sessions are great too, and he&#39;s a sweet person who loves teaching!Professor Blankenship is a great teacher. Biochem is difficult, but there are tons of office hours staffed by multiple TAs. Make sure you thoroughly answer the objectives for each unit by reading the textbook, watching the review videos, and talking over the objectives with a TA. If you do this, you are bound to get a decent grade.Doing well on the weekly quizzes will take up hours each week.  However, studying for quizzes makes studying for prelims relatively  easy and the material you learn in this class come back again and again in many other science classes and especially the MCAT.

However, there are always TAs on staff to help you out during the day.  Prof. Blankenship gives optional lectures, which can be helpful.  He was one of my favorite lecturers, which really says something, since this was an autotutorial course.Makes mud as clear as water. Excellent professor! His review sessions are short and sweet. Material can seem a little heavy, but is actually not that bad, especially with all the tons of help he and his assistants offer. Always wandering the study center asking if students need help with material, and asks for feedback on quizzes and tests.Jim is a nice guy, but his actual tests were 5x harder than the practice tests(actual tests from previous years). It could also be that this course was completely online this semester due to COVID. During the semesters where this class is offered in-person, the class is usually fine.

What an awesome guy.The greatest professor at Cornell and probably in all of New York state in the sciences. He genuinely wants for you to succeed - if you have a suggestion for the class, he&#39;ll weigh it and do it. He holds sessions for help applying to med school weekly.

At the end of every lecture, he goes out of his way to tell you what you need to know AND what you don&#39;t.This professor made me miserable.  I could not follow his lectures and he focused on equations and minute details rather than teaching us central concepts.  The one time I spoke to him outside of class he was very intense and kept repeating that I should have known something.  I left his office crying.  I simply stopped going to lecture.Gerry is the only professor I have ever had that actually goes way out of his way to help his students, even long after they are taking a class with him.

The level of detail you&#39;re expected to know is reasonable for a high-level cell biology course. Also, Dr. Vogt makes it easier with comprehensive lecture slides. Plus he really seems to care about the material and the students. It&#39;s a great cell bio class.Avoid the class if you can because: this is a 8:40 class; he has extremely detailed lecture slides; he grades papers on how well you can write in English; he is not the most engaging lecturer.The lecturer is not engaging in anyway while all the material is online, which is aggravated by the mandatory attendance at 8:40am. The assessments rely on you to memorise extremely specific details and punish you for not memorising them thoroughly. The material would otherwise be interesting if it weren&#39;t for the labourious memorisation required.I&#39;ve learned more in this class than any other class at Cornell. If you&#39;re at all interested in cell biology, this class provides the context you need. Don&#39;t fall behind in lectures, the material is DENSE and plentiful. Put in the time and effort and it will pay off. First time a prof will give you helpful practice\/feedback on scientific writing.Biology like you&#39;ve NEVER SEEN BEFORE. SO MUCH INFORMATION. WOW. After taking this course I have never seen biology the same way again. Honestly that&#39;s how much you learn. Reading papers is so much faster bc. of how much you learn.

He is extremely passionate on the subject and is more than willing to help you. The material can be specific, but attending lecture is definitely useful in order to know what to study for quizzes\/exams. He also adjusts grading of quizzes\/exams to bump up grades. Highly recommend!Really nice professor who is very knowledgeable. A bit too heavy on the lecturing for my preference but I&#39;m sure it works for some people. Overall a great guyDr. Winans is a nice, caring guy. I sometimes skip lectures but when I do go, it&#39;s just to hear what he has to say. The material is often clear and if you do the work, you should be fine. The class was moved online halfway through the semester but I feel like it is manageable both ways. He is also responsive to students.When I first signed up for his class, I didn&#39;t know what to expect. It was my first college experience and I was really nervous. However, once the first class began, Professor Winans blew away any expectations I had! His lectures were very easy to follow and the way he described the contents on his powerpoints instantly captured my attention!He&#39;s a very interesting lecturer that makes interaction during class very easy. He doesn&#39;t always have all the answers to questions but he will make an effort to find out the answer and get back to you. All the assessment material is really fair and everything can be found almost word for word on the slidesvery enjoyable class because of his great personality. material may be difficult and very detailed but he is willing to explain! weekly partner quizzes (MC) based on homework (MC), prelims based on HWs and quizzes. material is only lecture based and figures can be confusing so attendance is a must!","difficulty":3.0,"rating":4.8333333333},{"index":1016,"prof_name":"Steve Winans","prof_dept":"Biology","class_name":"BIOMI290","comment":"Taught the 2nd half of general microbio. when Ghiorse took a sabbatical leave.

Terrible lecturer and never clarifies his slides even when a student is confused. Students are always wrong on the polling questions.  The slides are literally pictures from the textbook without any words.  He does nothing to improve his lectures or clarity. Speaks as if everyone has already taken MicrobiologyHe was so bad. Quizzes and tests on the textbook, not lecture material.In  my opinion he gives the best lectures in all of Cornell! Absolute gem! He teaches with a style that just gets to you and makes you want to learn more about microbiology.Horrible lecturer. Was little to no help in office hours. Microbio was taught along with Professor Winans, who was MUCH better. Zinder couldn&#39;t explain the material and made exam questions extremely specific. Take this class with another profOne of the best professors I have had at Cornell! Made lectures very interesting, and it was very obvious how knowledgable he is. Definitely recommend taking this class.I really enjoyed his classes. He has a really relaxing voice, so beware of going to class tired.Steve was a great professor. His quizzes can be a little tough but he will adjust the curve to make sure the average is an acceptable score. His powerpoint slides are so informative and detailed that I still referred back to them even when I was taking upper level classes. He makes you work for your grade but we&#39;re at Cornell so what do you expect?Unfortunately, Winans has been the worst Professor Ive ever had at Cornell thus far. He single handily ruined Microbiology for me. The main problem for me was how disorganized his portion of the class was. He also directly contradicts his syllabus by putting multiple correct answers MC questions on his prelims\/quizzes. Dont take Microbio with himThe course was disorganized and his half of the course was even more so. His lectures never followed the lecture schedule, and his lack of assigned readings made it hard to know what to reference for extra explanation. He wasn&#39;t incredibly pleasant when I spoke to him either. He is knowledgeable about his field, but he ruined the subject for meOne of the best biology professors! Very inspiring.I loved his lectures and having the daily quizzes before lecture worked better for this class. Very engaging in class too!horrible lecturer. guy talks way to fast in class and i dont think he even knows what his lecture topics are while he is teaching them. Lectures are very disorganized and what information is required to know is not very clear. Good lecturer also!! first half of microbiology in spring semester is taught by him. Quizzes are straight-forward, but the midterm was kinda annoying with the True\/False questions. Awesome professor! No HW by the way!Took micro with him. Lectures can be disorganized and tend to digress from topics and makes up for lost time by rushing through lecture. Don&#39;t be discouraged if you feel you aren&#39;t keeping up with his lectures bc most likely no one else is. Very approachable and helpful in office hours. Would still recommend him, not the worst bio prof I&#39;ve had.He sometimes just throws chemical names at us and expects us to memorize them. He can get very specific. He&#39;s not that great of a professor.Professor Hay teaches the first half of BIOMI 2900. He&#39;s not the best professor ever. His explanations are unclear at times and he says a lot of incorrect things in lecture and has to go back and correct himself later. His quizzes are tough, as was the midterm. I&#39;ve heard that taking microbio in the fall is easier, so unless you can&#39;t take it then.He talks way too fast in lecture. I can barely understand him. He&#39;s also very unclear on a lot of the topic we go through. Quizzes are generally straightforward, but sometimes are too specific I feel. The midterm was dumb. I took the practice midterm and felt solid about everything, but the actual midterm was completely different and much harder.Hay speaks WAYY too fast. There is no breathing room for students to even write down their notes. His lectures are quite disorganized and I never really know what I&#39;m supposed to be focusing on. Reading the textbook and attending small group discussions was quite helpful. It also helps to have some prior background in organic chem and biochem.The lectures may at times seem complex but they are meant to be accompanied with the textbook. As long as you keep up on your reading the tests should be fine. The quizzes are literally from the homework. Don&#39;t really understand why so many people are complaining about the class when it&#39;s pretty straightforward.Great professor!! Loved him!!! Totally recommend this class. Quizzes are sometimes very specific and annoying, and final was kinda hard too.. but overall, it was very fine!I thought Winans was a nice guy and pretty good professor. His quizzes were pretty straightforward, but his final exam was somewhat difficult (had some short answers in addition to multiple choice). Anyways, you&#39;ll enjoy this class if you take it.Professor Hay keeps you interested in lecture (he threw chocolate at us a few times to teach us about fermentation!) His quizzes and exam were somewhat difficult and tricky for me, but overall the time commitment needed isn&#39;t bad at all. Anyways, this class is pretty good and anyone remotely interested in biology should take it.he is overall very decent - very clear and highly approachable - however, he&#39;s sometimes unorganized \/ goes too slow.One of the greatest professors! He made me a lot more interested in biology. He respects the students a lot and as well as every silly question a student might ask, whenever in class or office hours or emails. Additionally he always smiles at you!!! If he is going to teach another higher level class, I would definitely take whatever the subject is.","difficulty":3.1666666667,"rating":3.2916666667},{"index":1018,"prof_name":"Tory Hendry","prof_dept":"Biology","class_name":"BIOMI2950","comment":"Uber hard prep sheets (30% of grade and 5 pages each in great detail) each week about an article.

Nice guy, but should not be a teacher.  It might be more helpful to take this after starting independent research.Ick. This guy does his best to confuse the heck out of everyone in the class. He seems incapable of responding coherently to questions. Also, you learn S-Plus, which is from the 80&#39;s and from what I hear pretty much useless. The prelims are take home though, which is nice.Okay class. The worst part about the class is the use S-Plus. One of the worst and most antiquated programming languages in existence.

He seemed like he had no desire to teach this class at all as his lectures were very boring with few examples of how to do the statistics for ourselves. Additionally he went awol right before the final and students were panicking because we didn&#39;t know what was going to be on the exam and the TAs couldn&#39;t help us either.Prof. Sullivan is great!

He does go over the material rather peripherally, but that&#39;s because he simply doesn&#39;t have the class time to over stuff deeply. If you&#39;re taking this class as a requirement, you&#39;ll get by pretty easily. If you&#39;re taking this class as an interest, read the textbook to thoroughly understand the theory. But yeah, overall, 5\/5P-dog (as he is referred to by his students) is a really nice guy. If you bother to go to class and pay attention, you might pick up something but attendance is not mandatory. Easy grader and great professor overall. Take his classes!Stats is not an easy subject but Pat does a thorough job going over what you need to know to do research. If you put in the hours, ask for help if needed, and attend class you&#39;ll learn everything you need to know. He also teaches R in the process which is dead useful (and free).Great guy, boring lectures.Jeremy, oh Jeremy, what a man. While he was a really quirky teacher, and some people didn&#39;t like that, he truly knew his stuff when it came to statistics. The class was relatively easy and enjoyable, with little homework, but his tests weren&#39;t a good reflection of that we were learning.

His notes weren&#39;t clear enough. :(Very easy if you go to class. Super nice guyJeremy is one of the rudest, least professional professors I have ever had. Not only is his teaching style odd, distracting and unprofessional, he seems to hate students who bring up anything to do with grades. His tests are also extremely irrelevant to actually using statistics - they are more like decoding double negative T\/F questionsKind person, &amp; extremely intelligent. However: He went through slides way too fast, &amp; I ended up teaching myself the whole class &amp; R programming language. Provided very few practice problems you&#39;d see on exam. Concepts were not really explained thoroughly. 8am+kinda boring lecturehalf an auditorium of kids passed out. Would not take again :\/Very engaging teaching style. Gave extra credit and wanted students to succeed.The class is not difficult if you go to lecture and lab. Stats isn&#39;t really my thing so I didn&#39;t find the material very engaging, but if you keep up with the workload you will get a good grade. The professor gives extra credit if the prelim medians aren&#39;t where he wants them to be, and you can tell he wants students to succeed in this class.Knowledgeable, approachable, and very helpful at office hours. However, she does speak very fast and go through a ton of information each lecture, so be ready to go through lectures before\/afterwards on your own time. Be ready for 40+ slide power points in 75 minutes...He is very knowledgeable and nice, but he gives his lectures either too fast or too slow, and tbh, kind of boring. Exam mean and median are lower than previous years. Part of the reason is due to his ambiguous lecturing style... Overall I learned a lot from this class, but I won&#39;t take his class again.Jeremy is, well, goofy. He has this interesting wit that I truly thought was funny. However, his tests were literally out of left field; they were much harder than class material. His explanation of R is a joke. Does give extra credit. ILR stats way less work and easier, take that instead if you can.She is not clear, and even some youtube videos make clear points than she did. She basically just read through slides. Morning class!! Attendance is not mandatory but there is a weekly quiz on Thursdays. Appropriate homework load. Not many practice problems. Use R to do homework but didn&#39;t require to code in exam. Allow one self-made formula sheetLecture feels more like bad stand up than actual class. Not extremely enjoyable and the prof uses strange analogies instead of actually explaining why things work the way they do. Clicker quizzes aren&#39;t hard. There is no curve but the grading is somewhat generous.His lectures are awkward, and he is always picking on students. Beware of sitting in the front. He spends more time trying to be an awkward SNL character than a nice prof. He is also super rude.He knows a tremendous amount about his field and is very helpful in office hours because he asks questions that make you get the answer on your own. But he teaches off extremely confusing slide shows using made up variables and talks over an hour straight in his droning voice. Also his homework assignments are hard and often require TA help.Very helpful.  You can email him with a question at 10 at night and in many cases he will get back to you the same day.  Great office hours as well.  Can tell he really knows what he is talking about.

THEY WILL RUIN YOUR SOCIAL LIFE ENTIRELY!!!The class is nothing like it was supposed to be last year, but is still very manageable as long as you put in the effort.  Schwager&#39;s lectures are long and boring and he often goes into depth on really trivial things, but as you go on it gets more interesting.  Tests and homework are very fair and there are plenty of opportunities for redemption.This class is the worst class I have taken at Cornell in 3 years. The lectures are strictly powerpoint, and boring beyond belief. The problem sets are unnecessarily long (8-10 hours\/week) and relatively useless. Tests are not fair, objectively. He seems to have no clue how everyone in the class is doing. That being said, he is a very nice person.The class content was not difficult, however, grading was biased and arbitrary. His exam q&#39;s felt like they were testing your understanding of his psyche rather than the material. His behavior in lecture was also immature.

He posts no lectures online and often gets sassy with students when they ask for help. He goes on random rants about his life in the middle of class and awkwardly calls on people for no reason. Avoid this class.One of the worst lecturer I&#39;ve had for a biostat class at Cornell. No record videos and filled lecture notes. What he explains in lecture is really unclear and difficult to follow. Really unhelpful in Piazza. Avoid if possible.Her lectures are the worst. She just reads off powerpoint so fast, you have no clue which things you need to jot down (if she even stays on that slide for that long), literally my second semester with her and I only understood the first 3 or so lectures of each semester and the rest is just trying to understand her cluttered powerpoint. NoBook4HelpThe course itself is fine but it was taught in such an unorganized way that the material seemed harder than it really way. Those who did well attended multiple TA hours to get help on the problem sets. He also did not follow syllabus. I would not recommend taking any course with him.Earls is great at explaining things during office hours.

She makes the course and the material unnecessarily complicated. If it wasn&#39;t for the TA, I would have failed the class. Attending her lectures were the worst hours I spent on campus. She writes on a blackboard and her handwriting is just way too difficult to read and goes too fast. Take ECON3110 instead.Tests, like any math course at Cornell, are ridiculously difficult. A lot of the homework from the book is more theory based (small proofs), but the tests are I think all applied problems. Textbook and solutions can be found online. The curve must have been very nice because I did poorly all semester but managed to get a BThe text book is so much better than her lecturing. The class is pretty cool and straightforward. Just read the textbook and go through the example problems and you will do well. A lot of students do very well. Make sure you can integrate well (double integrals too).She&#39;s been teaching this class for a long time so it seems like she has lost interest. Lectures are pretty boring and people usually stop showing up to class halfway through. She does post all the notes online though and the material itself isn&#39;t too difficult. The TAs are also not great. Make sure to review the discussion questions and do homeworkBunea&#39;s class was hard for me. Definitely wouldn&#39;t recommend for someone who doesn&#39;t have background in Stats or some calc. That being said, she clearly likes the class and her students. She said some of the funniest things in lecture and was really open to helping me when I did poorly on a test. She gets a bad rep: unjustly.Probability theory is not an easy topic and Raj does an excellent job teaching an introductory class while gauging interest in upper level proofs. Everything is proved in class but the test are mostly based on applied cases. Vert few professors can make you better at mathematics and that&#39;s why Raj was excellent because he made al of us better!Good course! Lectures could be less dense thoughhorribleAvoid at all cost. Very distant and disorganized.She really cares about her students and wants everyone to understand. Very approachable. I&#39;ve heard this class in the spring was impossible but as an average student I thought this class was pretty easy. The tests were exactly what we did in class.Raj is a great professor! He does an excellent job of breaking down difficult concepts into smaller pieces, and does his best to make time for his students. He tries to squeeze in interesting storiestrivia during class to keep students awake. Tests are NOT regurgitation of HW problems, however if you understand the concepts well tests aren&#39;t hard.Great teacher. Her lectures are easy to follow and well paced. Overall, some more difficult concepts, so would not recommend if you&#39;re looking for an easier class. However, sassy, fun, and by far my favorite prof.Professor Bunea is always willing to help students (replies directly to students who have specific questions in class and by email), but has some really boring lectures.  She&#39;s stated that the course is more rigorous than in past years. I feel that grades  have to be earned with hard work now. 3 tests make up 90% of your grade, so study hard!Lectures are not engaging at all. She attempts to get people involved by asking questions, but is just greeted by awkward silence. Going to lecture\/recitation is not necessary to understanding the material. Just read the textbook. Prelims are based on recitation and homework problems, so if you do those, you&#39;re set. Low effort to get an A-.Lectures were always boring and unhelpful, so I learned everything on my own time to even do remotely well on exams.

He expects a lot, but this type of diligence is what&#39;s needed to succeed in college &amp; especially in chem2070 where grading is based off other students&#39; performances. Definitely recommend. You will learn tons of chemistry &amp; it&#39;ll put you ahead of the game in 2070.I took 1070 and have been a TA for 2070. He is by far the most caring professor I have ever had in college. It is not particularly prestigious to teach freshmen, but he chooses to because he wants to keep students from dropping out of STEM\/pre-med. Material can be hard, but showing that you&#39;re trying will get you far in this class. I cried too lolLove Dr. Lee! The only reason I even liked chemistry at all this semester and passed Chem 2070 with Woz was because of this genius. He is a very enthusiastic professor who really pushes you to grasp even the most difficult concepts.Wasn&#39;t sure if I&#39;d like him from the first few weeks of chem lots of yelling but after sticking it out, I have grown to love him. He genuinely cares about his students and is willing to do whatever for them to succeed. Dr. Lee has a very specific way he wants his students to do things but if you put in the effort to learn, it&#39;s worth it.DR LEE IS MY BOY. seriously the only professor on this campus you&#39;ll feel actually cares about you and your performance. he is all-knowing and he certainly has a &#34;my way or highway&#34; approach. but if you&#39;re riding in his car and place your trust in him, you&#39;ll certainly go where you want to.HE IS AMAZING. His father won a nobel prize and he definitely inherited his genius but chooses to teach mostly freshmen. General chemistry students learn how to critically think and problem solve on a much higher level than their peers. I got an A+ in CHEM 2070 and it is definitely because I put so much effort into Dr. Lee&#39;s class.Took 1070 &amp; 1080 with him and he is genuinely my favorite professor here. Listen to him, he knows what he is talking about and he knows how to bridge high school thinking and college learning. It wont be easy and you will need a GROWTH MINDSET but take 2070 with him you will thank yourself later.The best lecturer ever! Dr. Lee seems like the only professor on campus who actually wants you to succeed with the highest grade possible. He makes you work but hes hands down the best teacher Ive ever had.Took 1070 with Stephen and that was the only reason why I managed to get a decent grade in 2070. He genuinely cares about you and every single one of his students. If you follow everything he does and go through the hard problems he gives you, you will gain much better intuition. He is teaching 2070 next year- do take it with him!Dr. Lee is by far the most caring lecturer I&#39;ve had in all my years of learning. He makes every student work to their highest potential. He acknowledges that some students have gaps in their math skills and does everything in his power to repair these gaps and improve their critical thinking.

She is so accommodating and communicative. If you just talk to her, she will understand and is willing to make changes to ease up your stress. Yea the lecture itself is fast paced and the class is pretty test heavy, but she really made me enjoy the class.AWESOME.Class is hard but easy to pass. She promised a C- or more if you got 300\/500 points available in the class (including 50 participation points.) Class is test heavy, if you are not a good test taker, you are not going to do well. Check your exams after she gives them back, TAs made a lot of mistakes in grading.Professor Kinsland is the most accommodating professor I&#39;ve had during the Covid-19 situation in Sp2020. She was extremely understanding and changed the course to help us as much as possible given the circumstances. While I do agree that her class is difficult, she made it abundantly clear the amount of work you would expect at the start of the semTotally fine and what&#39;s expected. Slightly difficult, but difficult subject matter. Kinsland kept it interesting and kinda fun.Dr. Kinsland is amazing! She is so friendly and really invests time in students who invest time in the class by going to office hours and by seeking help outside of class. It is crucial that you go to lectures and take good notes because the lecture notes are what the prelims are based off of. I highly recommend doing the homework every week too.Amazing professor! Lectures were very clear primarily because they didn&#39;t revolve entirely around PowerPoints. She made excellent use of the blackboard to explaining concepts and was always friendly and willing to help during office hours. She was also willing to meet  one-on-one outside of office hours if you asked! Definitely take her  class! :)Wow I&#39;ve taken numerous &#34;Intro to&#34; courses during college but Cynthia&#39;s &#34;Intro Organic Chemistry&#34; is anything but an intro class. Hardest class I&#39;ve taken at Cornell, lectures are so fast you don&#39;t have time to comprehend the material, and there&#39;s practically no help available out of class (nearly 400 students and only 2 TAs?).If you want to do well on the exams, do the homework (similar questions). I found Kinsland to be quite bland and too &#34;try hard&#34; when it came to humor. Did not get a lot out of class. I knew a lot of friends who just did the work outside of class and never went to lecture and still did well on prelims.  However, the curve is huge.Cynthia has an amazing sense of humor. Her deadpan make me enjoy going to lectures. She always slips in some interesting facts and uses real life examples. She uploads annotated lecture notes which is nice but lecture are no substitute for the textbook (which is very good). Expect to memorize.Homework was optional, meaning it didn&#39;t have to be turned in. However, not doing the homework meant not being able to do anything on the exam, so you always have to do it anyway- it should be graded. Lectures were amusing, but not helpful in the learning process. I learned almost nothing from any lecture because she never explained what she did.All of the grades were from the three prelims and the final exam. There was homework but it was not graded or turned in. Not doing the homework will make the exams very hard. You have to do the readings. She does not explain what she is doing in lecture.Love Jane! A wonderful person, professor, and friend. Thank you!!Not enrolled but sat in on CHEM 1570 problem solving sessions, Jane is very caring, very knowledgeable, and very helpful in succeeding in CHEM 3570. Definitely enroll or at least attend CHEM 1570 sections!Lectures don&#39;t help, she goes by everything too fast, your entire grades are based on 3 prelims and 1 final, and to top the cake the materials gone through in class are &#34;orgo 2 level&#34;, according to my friend in a biochemistry major.

He thinks he&#39;s funny, though, and that&#39;s all that matters.chirik is the man.Chem is def. hard, but at least chirik makes it a little more interseting. He is funny and up beat in his lectures,so you dont fall asleep. The prelims are def. hard, but they follow from his notes in class! you dont have to read the book!Also he is very helpful if you go talk to him.take the classMarohn is not a good professor.  Sure, he&#39;s funny and tries to make chem fun, but he cannot teach.  He doesn&#39;t make any sense when he lectures and is not a good public speaker.yeah, funny sometimes, other times, no so much (although all the suckups still laugh) looks like science guy in Simpsons. Problem sets are evil (i hate aliens!), but yeah, he&#39;s nice.The best class.  Ever.  Bar none.  The best lectures, the best jokes, the best explanations...Chirik is the COOLEST person--go to his office hours at LEAST once, even if you don&#39;t have any questions.  And don&#39;t read a newspaper in class.  And listen for exam hints in the lectures.YOU SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS.  No, it&#39;s not easy.  No, he doesn&#39;t answer questions carefully and sometimes makes light of students&#39; stupid questions. But the spectacle that is CHEM 207 lecture makes it worth it.  I consider him a good teacher because you will learn a lot, and lectures are incredibly fun and engaging.  One of Cornell&#39;s best.funnyNot gonna lie....I LOATHED chemistry before taking 207, but Chirik made it so much fun. I didn&#39;t miss one lecture and because he&#39;s such a good professor, I&#39;m doing well in the class.  This is by far my FAVORITE class of the semester.  CHIRIK ROCKS MY WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!I took this class my first semester here and it is still one of my favorites even thought it was a pretty hard class.I didn&#39;t like him as much as some other people I talked to. He&#39;s not nearly as funny as he thinks he is, but his lectures were good becuase he blew stuff up. Prelims are very hard.No CommentsAlthough very informative, his lectures were boring. He didn&#39;t seem to cover the material well enough to just learn from them. Do the readings ahead of time!Not a horrible class but not one that I would want to take again.Good teacher.  Wrote and spoke clearly, unlike Crane.  The exams aren&#39;t ridiculous, so if you do the problem sets and readings you&#39;ll be fine.  Not a bad class, but I&#39;m just not too fond of chem in general.He&#39;s very clear, he tells you what to expect for the prelimsCHEM 207 is really not as difficult as most people\/pre-meds make it out to be.  Loring is a very good professor and very clear on what you need to know.  People have said he&#39;s mean to them when they ask questions, yet I&#39;d be mean too if someone handed me a problem set without any writing on it for help.  If you make an effort, he&#39;ll help you a lot.Presents the material clearly &amp; methodically (unlike Crane), though i could just read it in the textbook. like someone else said, if you can do the p.sets on your own, you&#39;re golden for the exams. Nothing he does makes\/breaks you in the class.Did not cover material from book and was incomprehensible most of the time. His lectures were incoherent and jumped all over the place. The final was hard too.I loved Chirik...1st chem teacher ever that 1) cared about how I did 2)made chem fun and interesting and not as tense 3)taught chem in a way I could understand it...Great class, hard prelims but not impossible and a good guySometimes, he taught really advanced stuff that i doubt was in the chem 207 curriculum, but he always made class interesting and mind-stimulating, even if you questioned your desire to be a chem major after a prelim. All in all, i thought it was a good class, and hey, he puts the board on fire and throws liquid-nitogened bananas around!You can tell he tries hard, but he still has a lot of improving to do. Not very clear in lecture, and tends to mumble a lot. Class is not curved very friendly, either, but I can&#39;t blame him for that. Overall, not that bad, but not the best either. Be sure to go to class when he gives demonstrations, they&#39;re worth itHis is one of the worst teachers i have ever had, excluding the junior high level (where they were all jokes). His lectures are the epitome of unclarity. He is utterly unable to connect the ideas being taught and tries to teach concepts in terms of the rules used to solve problems within those concepts.Totally awesome professor. Take his class.Awful.  I don&#39;t even bother going to most of the lectures since they don&#39;t help me at all-he goes way more in depth than needed in an intro class, and I just end up confused.  His handwriting is hard to read too.  Enroll in 007, it is really helpful if you want to get a good grade.OMG...he&#39;s sooo hot!!! i wonder if he&#39;s married and, if not, PLEASE tell me!No CommentsMarohn is not a bad teacher. He knows how to keep the attention of a room full of 200 students and is very clear as to what students need to know for the class. The more in depth examination of material can be very helpful in understanding the material, even if they are not neccesary for the course. His passion\/excitement is always apparent.Chirik is hilarious. His lectures are good, his tests are really hard. Don&#39;t read the book. He is one of the leading young chemistry professors in the world. He recently got a $525k grant.Funny guy and great lecturer. Gives hard prelims though.Dr.Marohn mumbles sometimes, and he does mathematical proofs that are sometimes too in depth for an intro. chem class.  However, proofs make the topics less dry, because you learn why things work the way they do.  Also, he has a passion for chem and is always willing to help those who need it.  If you focus in lecture, you&#39;ll get a lot out of it.she thinks she&#39;s funny.  she&#39;s not.I never looked forward to going to a class so much, esp. considering I hate chem! Chirik is so funny. The prelims are def. hard, but if you stay on top of the material each week and know what&#39;s going on, it is def. very possible to do well. Don&#39;t read the book.. lectures are all that count.No CommentsGreat class, the lectures are always fun and entertaining as well as interesting.  The exams are tough, they really make you think and analyze what you have learned but they are very fair.  Probably one of the best if not the best chem classe that I will have.he was really nice and i liked him, but i was confused a lot of the time. this was partly bc of the material covered thoughChirik&#39;s lectures are a blast... literally. However, the quality of the lesson could be better. Hes absolutely adorable and really funny though. Everyone loves him.Very funny guy.  Runs to all the prelim locations to answer questions!  Problem sets are killer.  Labs are always boring.  Exams are hard.  His personality makes up for it thoughBefore entering this class, I hated chemistry, and expected to hate this one and somehow muddle through.  However, I was pleasantly surprised. Chirik is an amazing professor who gets the material across in a great way.  His lectures are always fun to attend as well.  He&#39;s nice funny helpful and fairGreat professor, always telling jokes.  His tests are hard though and sometimes he throws a lot of info on the board without explanation.  He is a genius and works really hard though.He teached really well. He tells jokes and performs all these cool experiements.Hard class, but very engaging lecturer.  He makes lectures fun, but still conveys lots of information.  He explains and gives examples of how chem applies to real life so its not just science babble.Chirik is awesome! Prelims are challenging, but he makes the class sooo interesting. He likes to set things on fire and freeze things..Most devoted professor I have had. Really works hard for the class.Loves to give demonstrations, aka: blow up, burn, and freeze things.  Makes class fun.  The prelims follow his lectures, not the book, so you don&#39;t even need to read most of the time.Good guy.  His tests are pretty hard, but he does a good job teaching the material.  My only complaint is that he doesnt cover the harder examples in classGreat professor, lectures are always entertaining and easy to understand.  Prelims are difficult, but an A is definitely obtainable if you understand the material.  Avoid TAs for homework help, though, they usually lead you down the wrong track.humorous fellowNo CommentsLectures are fun and interesting, but prelims are pretty hard. Don&#39;t read the book - it&#39;s useless. Pay attention to lecture and take good notes and you should be fine.very very funnyCool guy, interesting lectures - but u have to go to them! They&#39;re kinda fun... its one class I never fall asleep in.Great guy - fun lectures. Problem sets can be hard, and the test is quite challenging, but not ridiculous.A hilarious teacher that is able to combine entertaining lectures with actual knowlege. Too bad my TA does niether :-\/He is hot and a great teacher. Sure his tests are hard, but he makes you think and grades fairly at the end.He seems nice until you realize that his problem sets are truly evil.  Frequent explosions in class make life more exciting. just one question-- why is chirik listed twice here?Good professor.  Very funny.  His tests were okay, learned a lot in this class.Awesome teacher, but watch the time restraints on the prelims. You do not have time to read the cartoons at the beginning of the test, although it may be temptingchirik is the best!!!!! too bad he only teaches one semester of chemOne of the best classes here - challenging but not overwhelming. You&#39;ll def. learn a lot and enjoy it.Let&#39;s be honest. Everybody loves Chirik. I haven&#39;t heard one complaint except that he can be a jerk outside of class, whatever that&#39;s supposed to mean. He really loves having the class as an audience and that shows. He&#39;s hilarious. He&#39;s lookin for a Nobel Prize.Even Chiriks seemingly endless wit in class could not make me interested in Chemistry. The exams are tough but straightforward.Chirik is a brilliant professor and person. He made me love chemistry, even though I came into the class dreading it. Yes, his tests can be difficult, but if you do the work, you will leave with an A. Chirik is absurdly funny, and he bends over backwards to help anyone who needs it. Chirik = Best.the best professor i&#39;ve had at cornell. brilliant man, clever, knows how to be really be a teacher, not something i can say for most professors hereAmazing lecturer!No CommentsHe burns the helium balloons, and freezes a banana, throws it up on the wall to shatter, and writes some kind of oil on the board and burns it.....etc. DURING the LECTURE .....does that explain? :) Very fun class to attend.Awesome teacher.  Makes chemistry so fun to learn.I hate chem and am horrible at it, but he made it more than bearable and quite manageable as well. Definitely the most positive chemistry experience I could have hoped for, given my dislike for the topic. Very entertaining and engaging lecturer; fair tests.Great class - you&#39;ll actually like going to it, which is amazing considering it&#39;s general chemistry. Great lecturer, cracks a lot of jokes and keeps it real. Tests are somewhat challenging, but are curved. They make you think on the spot, so don&#39;t expect just to plug stuff into formulas.I just want to back up everyone else&#39;s comments and again say.... &#34;I LOVE CHIRIK!!!!&#34; Seriously, this guy rocks... even though i still hate chem. But, lectures were exciting and funny. I miss him!He&#39;s a coooool dude...teaches in a fun manner...A-PLUS for him ^.^Chirik is definitely one of the better intro professors out there (for comparison, see Tom Owens).  It&#39;s been said before, but really the class isn&#39;t that hard.  The prelims usually consist of 7 problems, lack of time is what will end up stressing you out.Chirik does a really great job of keeping you interested in rather boring material... I&#39;m going by the beginning of the semester here because I&#39;m going to be honest, I never go to lecture haha... oops!No CommentsCHIRIK ROCKS MY WORLD! But his class is very hard, especially if you miss 2 seconds of lecture. The tests are actually easy if you know the material, but most people don&#39;t know the material... Oh well. He still rocks.Chem isn&#39;t gonna be easy unless you&#39;re already good at it. Chirik is really funny and is a good lecturer but dont let his charming personality fool you, the class is still difficult. Go to every lecture and take good notes.SOoo cool! Made me want to be a chemist.  I love his teaching, its reallly really good.Gee, his first prelim in 2005 was ridiculous, quite plainly.  He might be a humorous teacher, but the quality and relevance of his exams ought to trump humor.  This first exam was anything but fair as those who took it would agree.  So very picayune.  Chirik, I expected better.he&#39;s a funny guy, he makes class interesting all the time. tests are hard and he&#39;s not that clear with everything he teaches and some of it is pretty different from whats written in the book or told to us by the TAs.ex-nerd turned comedian. all around loveable good-guy.Wonderful presence combined with substance and clarity...one of my favorite lectures to attend!Orgo was one of the few classes I looked forward to going to, not for the subject material, but because I never knew what to expect from Ruttledge.  You don&#39;t have to love his sense of humour, but at least he didn&#39;t put me to sleep. Lectures are clear, he emphasizes what he wants you to know.awesome personality. really makes the lectures informative, scientific but every understandable for the student. take notes. go to lecture. go to office hours once in awhile, especially before prelims\/final.This guy is the best freshman prof I have had.In the past, I really didn&#39;t get chemistry, but Chirik made it clear and entertaining at the same time. A great chem professor and fair exams.No CommentsNo Commentsthe bestCrane is a chemistry master! If you are confused, go to office hours and knowlege will be absorbed into your brain through osmosis. Always willing to help and usually available, Crane has a good teaching style and a great sense of humor. Read the assigned chapters before lecture and you will be golden in his courses.He&#39;s not a bad guy and most people tend to do okay in his class, but he&#39;s not a great teacher.  He speaks too low and when he writes on the board, the writing tends to be faint and rather small.  It would be beneficial to keep up to date on the readings just because then you understand what&#39;s going on in class.  Tests aren&#39;t horrible though.Great guy, he knows his chemistryDon&#39;t sit in the front row; the residue from demonstrations will find its way over there. He was a friendly fellow, but his teaching wasn&#39;t always clear. I thought his exams were extremely fair; they were not meant to trick you in any way.not clear at all. sometimes i would have an inkling of what he was talking about if i went to section before the lecture. my advice: find a good TA and do your best to decipher the lectures. his exams were fair bordering on easy. with this class it&#39;s all up to you.Usually has cool demonstrations, which always make class interesting.  Definitely keep up with the readings to understand what&#39;s going on.  Tests were fair, sometimes the questions were pulled right out of lecture.he writes so small on the board (doesn&#39;t use ppt). p. sets &amp; exams are fair, if you understand the principles, class isn&#39;t really necessary for doing great.Great professor! I always walked out of lecture feeling like I learned something. Sometimes confusing with how he words homework and exam questions.  Two years ago, his prelim was supposedly easy.  This past fall, it was difficult but fair. Pay attention even to the more lightly covered topics in lecture. And read the textbook.Intro Chem is hard, there&#39;s no way around that, but Chirik trys to make the class fun and interesting. He is a really funny guy at times which helps to keep people awake. The pre-lims are hard and the TA&#39;s for his class don&#39;t speak much english, but all in all, Chirik is awsome.I went to all lectures because there were awesome deomos. He is funny and friendly.Chirik is awesome, his prelims are easy. Everything comes from the notes and the ?s arent too hard but the time restraint will kill uChirik is AMAZING!!! He is a great lecturer, who takes care to make class fun and interesting! And he constantly is making jokes! He explains the material really well, and is helpful in office hours. Prelims are solely based on notes in class, and are a bit hard, but its totally worth it!This man is a TERRIBLE professor. He doesn&#39;t really know what he is talking about and gets corrected often during lecture, especially by his superior, Prof. Lee. In order to do well, one must teach themselves. Consider this class to be &#34;auto-tutorial&#34;. Lectures don&#39;t correlate to masterinchemistry.com work, written homework, or exams.He&#39;s the most compelling lecturer I&#39;ve ever had, and manages to make Chem funny and understandable, too.  Before taking this class, I hated chemistry with a blazing passion; now I love it.  Chirik rocks!A genuinely nice guy that really knows chemistry and a really good teacher. Lectures are clear and understandable even though tough material at times.He is the best.  That&#39;s all there is to it.  His TAs suck, but he&#39;s wonderful!Chirik is AWESOME! I used to hate chemistry, but now I have learned to like it. I can tell that he loves chemistry through his energy and jokes. He is a great teacher. The prelims are very straight-forward but waaaay too long. Just remember to take good notes, and study the problem sets.i dont really get the love affair with chirik. everytime i asked him a question after class he was very quick and cursory in his answer and even gave me an attitude when i didn&#39;t understand something. some lectures were entertaining but they were mostly pretty confusing and boring. oh well, i only took 207 to fufill a requirementWhat a Professor! I was always looking forward to attend this class.Awesome professor!  He knows his material and makes the class REALLY interesting by blowing things up, setting things on fire, and just making the most out of chemistry!  Tests weren&#39;t too bad, definitely a worthwhile classNo CommentsUmm, he teaches &#34;chemistry according to Chirik&#34;... aka, he contradicts the textbook.    what is that ****?Great lecturer! Really funny too (in a high-school boy kind of way). Presents material in a clear, though sometimes fast, manner. Exams can be ridiculous sometimes and you wonder what he is actually trying to test, but overall, I&#39;ve had a pretty positive experience in Chem 207. Beware, though, the class is HUGE!He&#39;s really cool!  The class is fun, he uses good demos and makes the class very interesting.  Furthermore, he connects very well w\/ students.  The workload is reasonableTries to be funny at the expense of teachingThis guy is the best!The lectures are not boring at all because hes a funny guy.

Best I&#39;ve had so far at Cornell. Has an effective method of keeping your attention. Felt like I didn&#39;t really need to learn too much from the book after her lectures.not a fan....A bit slow at times, but definitely made it easy.Great teacher with humor.  Much better than mcmurraybetter than mcmurryshe made the material seem understable. however sometimes he goes too much on a detour even just trying to prove a simple point.This lady is hilarious (with a rather strange sense of humor)!!  She was unbelievably better than McMurry.  She definitely knows her stuff.  You&#39;ll definitely get a better grade in her class than you did in McMurry&#39;s.though not good looking at all, she is very passionate in teaching chemistry and always tries to be clear in what she teaches and very organized. If you do problem sets and read notes, u will be fine on prelimsawesome lecturer, definitely the best all yearShe makes chemistry enjoyable and understandable.  Her lectures are clear and has a strange sense of humor (made fun of handicapped people once).  Much better than McMurry, who simply reads off his textbook while teaching.A bit boring at times but knows the material and does her best to provide some excitmentGreat lecturer; clear one of the best I have ever had for science. Her class is a lot of work and T.A.s are not always that helpfulamusing and a good lecturerawesome lectures, and very clear and precise thought he problem sets were hard, they made me learnHe&#39;s an alright lecturer. Explains things but doesnt really show enough examples. He tries hard to keep people interested.No Commentsjerky in lectureNo CommentsDelivers introductory chemistry material slowly but in an effective way. Attending lectures helps hugely, as he goes over practice problems that are similar to required weekly homework. (Also looks like the grandpa in Up!)Demolished my interest in chemistry.  Taught useless information that was not even related to chemistry and expected you to know the information.She tries to make chem as easy as possible; shes really clear and you know what to expect on her exams.  She teaches at 175 MPH though, and forces you to take 4 pages of notes per lecture.My suggestion if you are required to take this course? Wait until it gets taken over by a new professor. Being one of the few people who actually attended lecture and came in with a really good background, the prelims were still pretty tough thanks to Zax&#39;s mean-lowering exam questions that seem to have nothing to do with what we&#39;re learningI hated her more than any other professor ever.  She had attitude problems.other than Dr. Ganem, the best chem prof. at cornell.  gen. chem SUCKS, but she actually makes the subject bearable.  all of you who are hating on her looks must have nothing better to do w\/your time.She runs a very interactive class, even with 500+ students. Not too sexy, thoughSo what that she&#39;s not the most attractive person, she made chemistry enjoyable.No CommentsNo CommentsNo CommentsCHEM TROLL!I couldn&#39;t stand the group problem set system (forced)...I didn&#39;t get it and my partners wouldn&#39;t help me, so I did no work and sucked in the class.good lecturesThis woman redeemed chemistry for me.She&#39;s easily the best chem teacher I&#39;ve ever had.  Her lectures are excellent and the problem sets are coherent and similar to the exam.hines was a godsend after chem 207. i actually enjoyed chem lecture.her repeated criticisms of new york city got on my nerves.  competent instructor, but i&#39;m not a big fan of her personality or her sense of humor.  group problem sets were somewhat helpful.No CommentsHorrible, expecially with the group problem sets.  She went way to fast and was hard to understandOne of my favorite professors at cornell! Homework problem sets are extemely hard. If you can do the problem sets by yourself then you are sure to get As in her class. She goes really fast through her lectures but her lectures are very clear and intreasting! You should definitely take this course instead of chem 216.I&#39;m a senior now but I took Chem 208 as a freshman and Hines was seriously one of two of my favorite science profs at Cornell. Yes, she goes fast and yes, the problem sets are a pain especially if your group consists of a bunch of slackers. But her notes are amazingly clear and no one ever said this class was a 1 credit class.Not the best lecturer, but he tries. His prelims are loooooooong. He could do a better job of using class time effectively (i.e. not so much math and more examples).Very smart professor! Gives really challenging but interesting problem sets.  After answering the problem sets correctly you get a sense of confidence.  The prelims are not as hard as the problem sets.Very clear and organized lectures.  Hard problem sets but comparably easier prelims!all i can say is don&#39;t enter her dungeon(office) or you may not pee right for a week.  i dont know what that means,  but i thought she was mean and unhelpful and scary.Lectures were a waste. He spent 50 minutes going over about 10 minutes worth of information and the rest was  spent with examples. Also, I went to meet with this professor one-on-one and he was not helpful at all. You can tell he wants to be a good professor, though.difficult course - def harder than 208. makes you work hard but if you put the work in you&#39;ll do well. problems sets are really hard, and the prelims are not pieces of cake either, you gotta know your stuffProblem sets are clear indication of what&#39;s represented on exams-- lectures are interesting enough.Complete waste of time if you took AP or honors chem in highschool.  Textbook is verbose, but contains little useful information.  Easy class though.Prof Hines obv knows what she is talking about...but she moves too quickly.  Going to office hours is terrifying.  She is not approachable or friendly.  As many of us observed, she doesn&#39;t seem as helpful to guys in the class as she is to girls...seemed like she never went the extra mile for guys, but if you&#39;re a girl no prob. it was irritating.Lectures are really useful for understanding the topics and different types of problems.  Always does a cool demo, like exploding gummy bears or a hydrogen balloon.  The practice prelims are pretty much on par and really help you prepare.Throrough and clear presentations of material in class w\/ fun demonstrations thrown in.  Definitely a good teacher for an intro. chem class.  A little more difficult than 207 in terms of problem sets, labs, and tests, but manageable.The queen of technology!  Her problemsets are impeccably done, but are fairly difficult.  If you get stuck with a crappy group, then you`re pretty much screwed (like I was), thereby bringing down your grade sadly.  Overall, I learned a lot though.It&#39;s an easy class as long you keep up with the material and do the problem sets by yourself or else you won&#39;t learn anything.Davis teaches from the book a lot, but is helpful and easy to understand. He seems to try not to make exams too difficult. However, he often doesn&#39;t teach something needed for a problem set or lab until just before it&#39;s due. Loves demos. Overall, makes the class fairly enjoyable and bearable.i love FLOYDLectures are very clear, and cohesive.  Problem sets are challenging in a good way, they force you to learn the material, and not so hard that you hate it.  The exams are similar to the problem sets and practice exams, if you know your stuff you will get a good grade.  Great and very well run coursedef. better than 207!  his tests are actually possible to pass, although the problem sets can be harder and take a longer time to complete. he seems really nice too...makes class bearable with his demonstrationsLectures are great; partly due to his clarity and partly to his demos. Understanding and helpful. The class was tough but problem sets and labs helped prepare you for exam.Cool Demos, wakes me up when I am sleeping in class. It&#39;s very easy. I got A+.I hated this class so much, but once i got to know hines better, she&#39;s a really nice womanGranted, I&#39;m not into chem. However, I enjoyed 207 with Prof. Chirik and expected to at least endure 208 in a reasonable manner. Nope. Lectures were too fast and very unclear, her sense of humor was occasionally offensive, her problem sets bordered on ridiculously difficult (and having groups was a horrible idea), and the exams were similar.She&#39;s the hottest chemistry professor ever.Don&#39;t listen to the Hines lovers. Professor Hines does not make any sense. Her problem sets are evil and her personality...Don&#39;t listen to the other people...prof hines is a witch.  Why are her problem sets always about killing people or making bombs or poisonous concoctions... hmmmm.she&#39;s no match for Professor Chirik (**very few are) but she is pretty clear in her explanations and quite helpful during office hoursOkay, my dislike of chemistry continues with a woman who didn&#39;t necessarily teach, but just wrote on the board. She made insulting jokes a lot of the time that just irritated people. I guess she was kinda helpful is you went to her for help, but still. She sucked. The course sucked.Exams are difficult, problem sets are difficult, lectures occur at the speed of light complete with jokes in bad taste, labs are not helpful. Granted, I didn&#39;t like chem to begin with, but somehow I got past it a lot better with Chirik.Dr. Hines is the best professor, I&#39;ve ever had at Cornell.  Not only is every lecture lucid, but she also ties many concepts together into one general rule.  Although chemistry involves many concepts, all you have to do is memorize those few rules and you can reason through all her exam questions.Decently challenging, exams are fair. Okay class, but not as good as Chirik&#39;s 207 (though maybe slightly easier).Another really great chem professor! Her lectures, although sorta fast-paced, really got you to understand the material (the graphs were helpful). She really knows her stuff and can teach the intro stuff clearly and intelligently. She&#39;s a genius.Very challenging, but I learned a lot.she was a great lecturer.  yes, the prob-sets were hard and the labs sucked.  but the exams (which basically determines your grade)was fair.Awesome problem sets - cool problems and very challenging.  Clear presentation and fair exams.He&#39;s a pretty good teacher.  Lectures are strait forward and easy to follow, an appropriate level for chem 208.  He&#39;s a p-chemist and it shows.  if you don&#39;t like math, this class might not be for you, but as a physicist I love it.i don&#39;t think i ever heard her breathe in lecture. intro chem should be a three day a week lecture. hines wasn&#39;t too helpful, and group problem sets are a miserable idea.  i&#39;d say don&#39;t take it, but it was a req for everyone, so no choice :(Waste of time.  I would have learned more by skipping class and reading the textbook.You can&#39;t ask for a better professor than Hines.  She is a great chemist. She does not have the same sense of humor as professor chirik, but she does make funny jokes related to chemistry. She is also very helpful in office hours.after taking 2007 with chirik...i can&#39;t possibly stand hines! she sucks and expects you to read the EXTREMELY unclear textbook in lieu of her unclear lectures\n \n good luckBoring.textbook is absolutely useless. never used it once except for looking up constants. the teacher is sometimes confusing. i relied on my AP Chem knowledge rather than her teaching. hw is much more difficult than tests, but prelims and final are easy if you go over the previous exams.No CommentsA true PChemist, she uses math to excess, when simply talking about chemistry would be much more helpful and ultimately more informative.  Geared towards math, incidentally, and if you aren&#39;t into memorizing equations and plug-and-chugging, you won&#39;t like the class.  I&#39;m not a 5day-weekend cheerleader, just for the record.  Insults aren&#39;t becoming.","difficulty":3.3058823529,"rating":3.4},{"index":1251,"prof_name":"Melissa Hines","prof_dept":"Science","class_name":"CHEM2080","comment":"Hines is bad. What angers me the most is that she doesn&#39;t bother to provide formula sheets ahead of the exam when half of the practice exams posted online require knowing what values and equations were given. This created a huge pain in the butt, and her group quizzes are ridiculously long and you better pray for competent group members.During a whole pandemic this professor did not even try to alter the class to benefit the students. Terrible.Hines is handling corona very well, and it shows me how much she cares and puts into the course. You can tell she has been doing it for years, is a chemist at heart, and also infuses her sense of humor\/ personality into a lot of the lab\/ group quiz readings, which I appreciate. Definetly not easy and you could get screwed with group quiz group thoHonestly dont know what goes on in P Hines head. She gives us grade ranges after each test, but out final grade does not reflect those ranges at all. I emailed her and the chemistry office but received no reply back...Prof Hines tests were okay and seemed to be curved pretty generously. The group quizzes, although pretty ridiculous, were graded leniently by the TAs who knew that we learned nothing in lecture. But grades came out lower than expected, and we are left with no explanation of how our grades were calculated and no email responses to questionsNot a bad lecturer but I disliked the class. In multiple instances, she hasn&#39;t taught us a topic yet but expects to understand how to solve it in the group quizzes, and then proceeds to teach the material the day the group quiz is due. She also gave practice exams without formula sheets where you literally could not solve without the given data.She is not a very clear lecturer. She gives you one example of the entire topic that she is teaching and teaches it one way. She gives no opportunity for improvement. I learned nothing in that class. Kyle was so much betterHines&#39;s lectures are structured, organized, and well-prepared. The group quizzes are hard, especially if your group is incompetent, but the prelims are fair game so long as you pay attention in lecture, take notes, keep up with the material, and at least attempt the group quizzes. The course is challenging but rewarding if you put in the effort.kind of all over the place, not such a great lecturer.  boring except that he is cute.Lectures and Learning Catalytics are critically important to understand and grasp the concepts and ideas. Group Quizzes are a little more challenging but help you to master these concepts. Prelims are tricky but everything you need to know is either said by her or written as notes. Only a few TAs are helpful. Review notes daily and practice.During the pandemic she has not eased up on us at all. I guess she does not seem to care that we have personal problems during this time. Before the pandemic, she was kinda okay. Her lectures are organized, but doesn&#39;t explain things too well (she just expects us to know background info). She also doesnt give a lot practice problems for tests.Not horrible class. Topics are more abstract then in 2070 (except MO theory) so I found the content harder to begin with. Hines is a clear lecturer and exams are VERY close to the practice ones (almost identical prelim 1). Don&#39;t pay attention to group quizzes for prelim studying. asks questions in ways you must fully understand material to answer.In all honestly, the material was not difficult, but Hines made sure that the level of difficulty was challenging. I used the textbook religiously and made my own problem sets. The group quizzes were tedious and usually way above the level that would get tested on prelims. Know how to apply the content and LCs were helpful!An overall nice class. If you put in the work you will get the results you want. Prelims questions are not necessarily hard but just hard to understand. Study old tests and lecture notes. Read textbook like its your bible for prelim 1 and prelim 2. For the final start early and religious study lecture notes and do prac final.I got a B in CHEM 2070 so I was expecting 2080 to be about the same level of difficulty. WRONG! If you can take this course equivalent at another school I highly recommend doing it. Taking it at Cornell isn&#39;t worth the stress and anxiety.Really nice prof. You don&#39;t really need to go to class because he posts lecture notes (I didn&#39;t go 95% of the time). Just skim the notes, do some problems, and you&#39;ll do fineProf. is not very good at explaining concepts and became harsher when things went online from this pandemic.Clear Lecturer, nothing unexpected.  go to class and know everything he writes on the board.  Far less difficult than other premed classesThis woman clearly lacks compassion for students, especially during a pandemic. The group quizzes are horrible and unnecessarily long, the prelims are even harder, and the material is very poorly explained with little to no practice problems provided.Chem 2080 was harder than chem 2070 for me but I got a better grade. Dr. Hines is a very good lecturer and she gets straight to the point. She isn&#39;t as caring as Dr. Lee but she makes an effort to provide for her students. Group quizzes are extremely hard if you end up in a bad group. Prelims are difficult as well. Good luck!Does not care about students at all and I have seen that over the years the same problem arises where students get grades far lower than they expected because she needs her curve to look a certain way. Handles the online conversion terribly and class actually got more difficult. There was clear evidence of cheating on the final impacting the curveBy far the worst professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Poor lecturer and actively looks for ways to decrease her student&#39;s gradesThere are no lecture materials available outside of class, and her writing is very difficult to understand and translate into notes quickly before it gets erased. Group quizzes are a great way to guarantee that each student masters about 25% of a given week&#39;s material.Take it with a different professor if possible, she wasnt very helpful before or after going online.I had Professor Davis for CHEM 2080. While his lectures may seem a bit dull at first, they become interesting, and they are invaluable to passing this course. He always tries to keep things interesting, and always shows cool demos. His prelims are extremely fair. If you studied well, you will have no problem. Overall, Professor Davis is a good profThe lectures are pretty heavy. Better go prepared e.g print the lecture slides maybe. Prof D used 90% of the lecture time going through some tough practice problems which turn out to be pretty helpful when studying for prelims. Labs started out tough and get a little better toward the end, so really work on those lab reports!Professor Hines&#39; lectures covered the basics well but were never enough to solve problem sets or group quizzes alone. Tests were quite difficult. There was little accommodation post-covid. Her grading scheme makes it very difficult to know what grade you will get in the class because everything is graded how well you do relative to the meanHe was fine but nothing special. Tests are tricky, because he only really covers the bare minimum in classProf. Davis did an OK job.  His explanations were very clear and simple.  Often he ran out of time at the end of lecture and scrambled to finish demos.  The first exam was way too easy and was compensated for by a much more difficult second exam.  Overall, he was fair and did an OK job.  I stopped going to class eventually and still did well.Good lecturer. Tests weren&#39;t super hard, but the labs and group quizzes were quite tough before the pandemic. Online exams were not well planned and inequitable for a ton of students. The material really isn&#39;t that difficult... but the grading is harsh.While Hines is a good lecturer and her tests are fair, the class itself is very hard to get a good grade in. However, this is typical for a gen chem course. The reason for such a low rating is because after the class switched online due to COVID-19, there was NO compassion for students and no action was taken to help students succeed AT ALLAwful. Cold. She was terrible before the pandemic - but since then we really see who she is. Not a nice person. Uncaring. Ridiculously hard grader. AVOID.Ever since corona the class has become impractical online for many students including myself.test were pretty straight forward and similar to past prelims. there are weekly group quizzes, so its not good if you have a bad group. not accommodating at all during the switch to online class, made work load even more. lectures were not recorded when in class. if you can do group quiz questions and past prelims, you will be fine on tests.I dont even know where to begin with this professor. She showed absolutely NO empathy to her students during this pandemic and did not change her expectations at all. Student did not have access to the same resources and environment and still he expected the same. Obvious that she cares about her board of trustee status more than her students.There are group quizzes every week, which are monstrously long and contain questions that take more time to decipher the meaning of than to actually do. The tests are extremely difficult, with low class averages. General chemistry is not a difficult subject, but this class makes it difficult.The class seemed a lot like a high school class. Tests are very predictable, homework and labs are easy. It&#39;s very clear what she expects you to know. She moves at a slow pace and practically screams her lectures. Having to turn in homework in groups is the worst idea ever.She is an excellent professor who tries really hard to keep you interested during thee lectures. Overall, I like her philosophy on teaching and her teaching style. The quizzes can be challenging however and this may just be my TA, but I&#39;ve found that the labs are graded more harshly than in 2090.Favorite Professor of Freshman Year! Lectures are incredibly clear and loved learning catalytics test questions. The Problem Sets are extremely hard and the lab is tough but thought her tests were very fair.She clearly tries really hard in lecture and knows the material, but the administrative changes she&#39;s enacted (like forbidding help with homework and labs, even from TAs) is incredibly obnoxious. Depending on your TA or assigned study group, you can really get screwed. Prelims are usually difficult and learning catalytics is unnecessary.Good professor, class is challenging but curve is generous. Group quizzes can be hit or miss depending on your group especially since TA&#39;s won&#39;t help you.Hines is a great lecturer I believe who explains everything very well. I opened the textbook once or twice throughout the semester; she is clear on what you should know. I only hated having group quizzes, but if you can do them mostly then you&#39;ll be fine for prelims. Learning catalytics is very helpful and good to review 4 prelims. Curves generous.great professor.  really nice, really good at what he does.One of the best professors I&#39;ve had! Great lecturer that gives real life examples based on materials being learned in class. Very generous with exams and curve. Very helpful when you go to office hours. Bad points: group quizzes that TAs are not allowed to help on. If you&#39;re stuck with a stupid group and a harsh TA, you&#39;re out of luck.The class itself isn&#39;t bad. Lab work is manageable. Her lecture style makes it impossible for me to learn. Her TAs are clueless so you&#39;ll constantly be lost. Prelims are impossible and I&#39;m beyond screwed for the final. You&#39;ll have weekly group quizzes and they are absolutely horrific. An overall frustrating class.Hines obviously wants her students to succeed, and her lectures are helpful and fairly easy to follow. The prob sets (aka group quizzes) were usually very hard, and the labs were challenging. The group quizzes can bring your grade up, but if you&#39;re too embarrassed to ask the strangers in your group how they did a prob, you can get left behind.Hines is a great professor! She is super nice and actually cares about the students. She understands that most kids in her class are biopremed students so she did a lot of examples relating to chemistry applications in medicine. This wasn&#39;t an easy class, but she wasn&#39;t out there to get you like other professors sometimes try to do. By far, the most organized, clear, and prepared professor I&#39;ve had. She is exceptionally clear about what you need to know, and she&#39;s more concise than the book. She frequently throws in funny anecdotes or relevant medical applications. Labs force you to think and group quizzes are brutal, but compared to 2070, the class is much less demanding.Professor Hines is by far my favorite professor thus far at Cornell. It was clear that she dedicated a lot of time to organizing her class. Her lectures were remarkably clear, engaging, and purposeful. I liked the concept of group quizzes every week, but I was extremely lucky with my group since we all helped each other understand. The lectures are fine, group quizzes are okay, but you can get screwed by who is in your group. Also, the prelims are not representative AT ALL of the caliber of questions we get exposed to. Finally, if you miss a lecture and don&#39;t have a friend in the class -- you&#39;re screwed. The lecture material can only be found in the lecture itself.","difficulty":3.98,"rating":2.7},{"index":1252,"prof_name":"David Zax","prof_dept":"Science","class_name":"CHEM209","comment":"Zax isn&#39;t too bad. Lecture is essentially the book but more confusing. Labs are easy, tests are a curve ball, though not impossible. It&#39;s clear that Zax doesn&#39;t want to be there, but he knows you don&#39;t either so everything is ok! Overall I&#39;d rather take this course than 207 (which is much harder and you have to do lab write ups).Bad prof, clearly does not want to teach. Avoid taking this course in the fall so you can avoid this guy! Some other better prof teaches in the spring; Zax teaches in the fallnot a very goos lecturer. all you can do is read the text and sit in on some of the 207 lectures. also, no practice prelims for this course, so try stealing some problem sets from your 207 buddies for practice. prelims and final very hardterrible teacher, please do not take him if you have the option...he is a terrible lecturer and the prelims never cover material that was covered in class...For the most part, Zax&#39;s exams are measurements of God-given Chemistry brilliance, and studying is pointless. The textbook was a savior for this class, as lectures were pointless and the overall class attendance reflected this. It seemed like Zax would rather be doing research than lecturing.Professor Hines made Chem209 surprisingly bearable. Clear lectures and very reasonable exams. Problem sets are time consuming, however.After taking CHEM 209 I felt I&#39;m fooled... The lectures are not that bad, but unfortunately Prof.Z does not like including what he said in the exams. Wish you good luck if you really really want to take his course.Zax reminds me of a kid that has no friends and he likes to rant about Nobel Prize winners. If you didn&#39;t take AP Chem in high school good luck!Not a great lecturer. Doesn&#39;t cover material that appears on the prelim. The prelims aren&#39;t terrible (the final however, was fairly difficult). Textbook is great though and is basically the only thing you need to do alright. Overall, course is pretty easy, but Zax is not organized and you probably won&#39;t do any worse if you skip every lecture.prelims test reading comprehension more than actual chemistry. the textbook is a saving grace because lectures are pointless.Helpful when I went to office hours, but the lectures were almost completely pointless, and the exams were basically tests in making stuff up and hoping it made sense.  Half the class stopped going to lectures by the end.Zax has no idea what he&#39;s talking about. spends all his time explaining what he won&#39;t be teaching, tell awful jokes.Yuck. I do not recommend Zax. He seems like he&#39;s a really nice guy, and I think that I could approach him with questions fairly easily but its the only lecture that I&#39;ve skipped more than twice. Boring and pretty much useless lectures. No review sessions, prelims are horrible and you are very unprepared, even if you study what he teaches.Very helpful, great teaching style and wit. Readily available for assistance on otherwise complicated concepts. He was also voted best prof by the students for the past two years. Highly recommended!What can i say... Zax makes things harder than they are.Unwilling to help students during office hours. Dodges questions and acts condescendingly toward students. His tests have very low means. If you haven&#39;t taken AP Chemistry in high school, then you will have a lot of trouble passing this course.Must be the most useless soul living on God&#39;s Green Earth. Spends lectures ranting about the history of chemistry rather than chemistry itself. He must have an inferiority complex or something, he talks to us as if we are dog crap. I have never run into a more worthless teacher in my life.Perhaps the most useless lecturer in existence. His jokes are tasteless; his notes have nothing to do with the class. 5 minutes into the lecture, you&#39;d ask yourself, &#34;WHY THE HELL AM I STILL HERE?&#34; If that doesn&#39;t say enough, he also likes to smirk at his students while they&#39;re taking the ridiculous prelims, knowing they will fail miserably.","difficulty":3.9444444444,"rating":1.5},{"index":1253,"prof_name":"David Zax","prof_dept":"Science","class_name":"CHEM2090","comment":"Zax is unfortunately one of the worst teachers I have ever had. He has literally described concepts as magic and makes the simplest things confusing. His demos usually have nothing to do with the lecture of the day and he often messes them up.  I generally enjoy chemistry but this was a very poor class.He is a great professor, and makes sure that students who need help can receive it. He is informative, and he tries to make this class fun.Best chem professor ever. Nuff saidLectures were absolutely terrible and because of that it&#39;s extremely hard to do the homeworks and tests. Impossible to pass the class without reading the book yourself and viewing Khan Academy videos. Would NOT recommend.Prof Zax&#39;s lectures are extremely unclear and often painful to attend. His power points look similar to something a 6th grader would create, he&#39;s not concise, and he often comes across as very condescending towards his students.  Just read the textbook and do the problem sets. Labs are easy, prelims are not - &#34;designed so no one would finish&#34;...His lectures don&#39;t relate to any of his homework sets and are very sporadically taught in general. His lectures are often hard to follow, even if you know what you are doing. He has also describe the reason behind some chemistry to just be &#34;magic.&#34; Questions during lecture have been answered with quick responses that don&#39;t clarify what was asked.The test does not reflect homework. He teaches beyond what he&#39;s supposed to teach and puts them on the test. Lectures fast and hard to read handwriting or understand his pronounciationNo CommentsLectures are easy to follow but do NOT reflect the exams. Repeats test questions so does not give practice prelims or study guides.hard to understand but he&#39;s a very good professor. doesn&#39;t go over the whole book though so you must read it to do wellGood lecturer, but topics are presented out of order (in a way that I found non-intuitive). The course (especially the labs) might be very difficult if you&#39;ve never been exposed to chemistry. Exams are more or less fair, but there are one or two curveballs on each one. Study the lecture notes carefully and read the book to do well.Horrible teacherDefinitely not the best teacher, prelim means were always low, but didn&#39;t have to do much work to get above the mean on everything. Zax acts like he doesn&#39;t want to be there during class and his demonstrations NEVER worked. Didn&#39;t get much chemistry knowledge from him, but overall the class is boring, but not too hard.Rather useless professor.Terrible professorEverything I learned was from the textbook. I should have skipped 90 percent of the lectures.Zax removed all of my interest in chemistry. If he spent as much time actually teaching as puffing out his chest then we would possibly learn something. And his incapability at both teaching and demonstrations degrades my perception of Cornell.Horrible teacher. Horrible Experience. Unhelpful. Arrogant. Mean.tests go way above the chem 2090 syllabusDoes not care about students. Tricky exams with many application questions.Needs to work on clarity, and making labs more relevant. Also needs to understand that no one takes chemistry by choice, everyone is there because its required.Purposely makes exams impossible to finish, lecture is useless, not helpful whatsoeverEasily the worst professor I have ever had, and I&#39;ve had my fair share of bad teachers.  This guy has no desire to hand his knowledge to his students, he&#39;s too full of himself and his previous research to even care about his students learning.  Don&#39;t bother going to lecture, reading the book and going to AEW will save you in this course.Extremely hard to understand in class and read what little information he puts on the board. Definitely should not be teaching an intro class for freshmen.Lectures were completely uselessI thought I used to like chemistry. His lectures are incredibly unclear unless you already solidly know the material. His tests are tough, no doubt about that. Lectures seemed to be unrelated to homework or labs--studying the homework and textbooks are the key to passing. Was fairly condescending in class.  Would not recommend.If you like lectures that go on random tangents that have nothing to do with the tests, Professor Zax is the teacher for you! Worst at Cornell thus far. If you have no chemistry experience, you will likely have a very difficult time.Terrible handwriting + doesn&#39;t know how to erase the chalkboard. He has trouble pronouncing things. Goes into his own research and escapes the bounds of General Chemistry like he&#39;s supposed to be teaching.Lectures are useless. Much of what is covered in class is unnecessary. However, random online questions for credit are posted often throughout the lectures so attendance is mandatory to get credit. If you are fine learning on your own by using the textbook\/youtube, you will be fine. But having to go to lectures that do not help is annoying.Very passionate and sort of funny, but lectures aren&#39;t very helpful if all you care about is getting the grade and fulfilling your requirement (although there is an attendance grade); instead of teaching the material you&#39;ll be tested on, he mostly talks about history, proofs, experiments, etc. I didn&#39;t use the textbook at all.Avoid this professor at all costs. Especially is you aren&#39;t a ChemE. If you do end up in this course, use the previous exam questions on the problem sets to study for the tests. and good luckThe tests were by far that hardest I&#39;ve taken at Cornell, more so than MATH 1910 which is supposedly to weed out the under achievers. He told us it would be one of the easiest classes we would take at Cornell. So not true.To sum up CHEM 2090 as Wolczanski taught it: useless lectures and hard exams.  I generally did ok because I had a high quality non-AP chemistry course in high school; had I the AP credit, I would not have wasted my time with this class. In general, there was nothing I learned by going to lecture that I would not have by reading the book.I learned so much in this class. It was a lot of work and we covered much more material than we were supposed to, but I loved it in the end. Prof. Wolczanski is just brilliant. He seems a bit mean initially, but he&#39;s actually really nice and extremely helpful.Abru\u00f1a clearly isn&#39;t all that interested in teaching at this point in his career. His lectures are dry, the course homework doesn&#39;t prepare you much for the exams, and the exams are brutal with targeted 50% medians. During the Chegg scandals, he did nothing to find cheaters and instead canceled the final exam. I&#39;m so lucky I got to take it S\/U.Brutal class. Barely teaches and loves to ramble. Read your textbook, redo sapling problems, and go to Cara&#39;s problem solving sessions - all infinitely more helpful than he was. I skipped lecture but be warned 10% of tests is stuff from lecture. Speaking of tests, impossibly difficult. Too many hard questions with not enough time. Averages are 50%By far the hardest class Ive ever taken. I only got a B+ in this class because I sacrificed all of my time for working out and going out to study for chem. The mean was around 50% on both prelims. Hector ridiculed students for not knowing answers in lecture. Even worse is that the class was 75% AP Chem students who already learned the materialHe might be a good researcher, but he&#39;s a terrible lecturer (his lectures are unintelligible). There are some cool demos that he does in class but some of them can be thrown in the exams. Tests are just ridiculously hard; do the problem sets posted on blackboard, they do help a lot.Lectures often consist of very cursory glances at topics, while tests go very in-depth to the same topics, and often include material that is not written on the slides\/notes. Exam means are around 50%, so be ready for extremely hard tests. Best if you can teach yourself well. To succeed, you must put in tons of time out of class.He teaches straight from the textbook, which means you can pretty much do all the readings on your own and still make it. That said, the exams are really difficult with low averages(the first prelim was a raw 56). Also, if you&#39;re not going to pay attention in lecture, don&#39;t wear a shirt that stands out or he&#39;ll call on you.He&#39;s hilarious in the sense that the amount of chemistry you learn from him is hilarious. He&#39;s a great guy, definitely fun to talk to, but if you&#39;re not interested in chemistry, you&#39;re not going to pay attention. You can get away with just going to AEWs. Beware of wearing shirts that stand out.He started off the first lecture saying &#34;This class is going to be curved to a B-,&#34; and it turned out to be true. My friend and I got a 57 on the first prelim. Chem 2090 was more like me teaching myself rather than learning from Prof. Abruna. SKIP CHEM 2090Brutal lectures, he just runs through material and goes topic to topic making no sense.Enthusiasm teacher! Nice person!!His lecture slides were paragraphs he copied from the textbook and Wikipedia. He spent the lecture mumbling these paragraphs to the class. I highly recommend taking the AEW for this course because it was my most useful resource for preparing for his extremely difficult exams. The exams were random, rarely reflecting the lecture\/textbook content.This class was absolutely awful. Lecture is a joke as he just reads of straight from the slides which come straight from the textbook. Homework is every week at least and doable if u read the textbook. Then you walk into the prelim and get absolutely murdered. Half the prelim was on a topic he said is irrelevant. Go figure. Means were 60 and 50.His lectures can be interesting to those of you who already took AP Chem and plan to become a Chemical or Biomedical engineer. Otherwise, they are not at all helpful. He does not teach what is tested on prelims. If you want to get an A in this class then you should really hit up the textbook when prelims come around. His demos are A++ though.Very, very passionate about chem, however the teaching is not great. Nice guy, funny at times, but confusing. If you have a very strong background and great interest in chem, some of his lectures will be very interesting. If not, they are confusing, boring, and not helpful for exams. The homework and textbook are necessary to get the material.Marohn is very passionate about chemistry. TOO passionate. He&#39;ll go off on spiels and tangents like nobody&#39;s business. I can think of only one class where he ended the lecture on time. What are his lectures so long for? I have no idea, because the practice problems in the homeworks taught me more than his lectures ever didProfessor Wolczanski teaches a lot of interesting things that are not really contained in the textbook. If you have a TA that knows what she is talking about and can help you with the homework, it is possible to do well in the class. He assigns extra homework problems that he writes that end up being exactly like test questions.I don&#39;t know anyone in his class went to lecture after the first three weeks. He seems to emphasize minuscule ideas while passing over big concepts. I did okay in the class by just reading the textbook and doing the homework. Biggest piece of advice is DO HIS EXAMS from previous years to study for your exams. This saved my grade.He reads off the slides, so lecture is barely useful. He does cool demos during class sometimes. The exams are ridiculously difficult in comparison to what lecture and homework would lead you to believe.Lectures are a joke. You learn nothing that will actually show up on the exams. The homework can be difficult at times but yet still won&#39;t prepare you for the prelims. Prelims are impossible, expect to see material you&#39;ve never seen before and to not have the time or ability to finish the test. He takes great pride and joy in watching you struggle.Do not take Chem 2090 it is the worst class I have ever taken. Lectures are a complete waste of time as the prelims are stupidly hard and you won&#39;t be able to do most of the problems on the prelim. Dude went to China while we had prelim that no one finished or had a clue what they were doing. So if you hate yourself take chem 2090.Throws in interesting concepts and ideas during class. Easy to understand. Comes well prepared.Good content, but  worst professor ever. The class covers materials that way exceed the capability of Freshman engineers.Does very few problems in class--the ones he does are a joke. Homework can be difficult for this reason. Prelims are torture: most people don&#39;t finish a large portion of it and there will be many intense problems that he has never taught you how to do. TAKE THE AEW! Reading the textbook is a waste of time, just do harder problems from each chapter.He&#39;s a funny prof who tries to keep lecture interesting by mentioning real-world applications of Chem. But lecture material is not useful for prelims, which were fairly hard. He is incredibly helpful during office hours. HW can be tough, but helps the most for exam prep. Class isn&#39;t difficult overall as long as you make sure you understand the HW.A nice and funny professor. Prelims imo were pretty hard but some people did really well on them so its possible to do well. Lectures are posted online so you dont have to go (the textbook is better sometimes). Homework helped the most in studying.First day of class, he said &#34;This class is curved to a B-. Lots of it is boring. I don&#39;t care about you since there&#39;s 500 of you in here. Let&#39;s get this over with.&#34; Lectures were useless, prelims were impossibly hard and irrelevant to the homework given, and it wasn&#39;t a reasonable expectation for anyone to do well.He&#39;s obviously very passionate about chemistry, but he&#39;s horrible at teaching it to students. His lectures are not helpful at all. They only confuse students more. The proofs he does are pointless and don&#39;t actually convey the material you need to know to do well on the prelims. Would recommend signing up for an AEW, you&#39;ll learn way more.Hated this class the moment he stepped in. He rambles a lot, and I think half the time he did not follow the curriculum. Instead, he discussed his own personal research and went far beyond what was necessary during lecture. Was very disappointed with his ridiculous exams, but he is occasionally funny and is truly, extraordinarily brilliant.Chem 2090 with Prof. Wolczanski sucked.  His lectures are not worth attending; just read the lecture notes he posts online.  Tests are hard, you&#39;ll somehow be saved by the curve.  I still don&#39;t understand chemistry.  He also has a wicked sense of humor (not in a good way- think mean).Easily the worst professor I have ever hadHe makes a lot of drug references in my class, maybe he likes to party? But this class is no party for the students; he makes everyone regret not placing out of this class.Lectures are virtually useless, as he gives material that not only fails to appear on the test, but that the TAs don&#39;t even know how to teach because they only just learned it in grad school classes. Also has a very monotone voice and uses high-level terminology that makes lectures almost impossible to understand.I wish he would just be more respectful to his students. No one appreciates his disdainful comments about engineers when we ask for help.Prof. Crane isn&#39;t always the most exciting lecturer, however, he keeps things interesting with frequent demos, explosive Fridays, and &#34;extra topic&#34; lectures. He&#39;s always approachable, and is extremely helpful during office hours. Exams can be ridiculous, but they&#39;re always curved. Recommend doing textbook reading.Unfortunately, Prof. Crane does not generate too much enthusiasm about the subject. The concepts might seem easy, yet on the final or prelims they suddenly become much harder. It is a fair class overall. Not a wonderful lecturer, not bad either. If you have the McQuarrie textbook, good luck. It&#39;s worthless. HW problems don&#39;t really prepare for exam8th grade math yo, actually though just CASE outKnowledgeable and passionate about the subject.  Not the most interesting lectures and i found I often found myself teaching the material to myself but his office hours were very helpful. Go to office hours and READ THE TEXTBOOKPretty good lecturer. Don&#39;t listen when he says the tests are like the homeworks. The tests are 10+ times harder. But they are curved, so if you know your stuff a good grade isn&#39;t too hard to get. Just pay attention and go to lab and you&#39;ll be fine.Very boring lectures, but they are informative. Prelims were fair. Don&#39;t fall asleep in lecture and do the HW and you will do fine.He gives out the aura of a very intelligent scientist.His lectures are pretty boring. He doesn&#39;t really use the textbook for teaching, but I still learn a lot by myself from the book. Tests are based on his lecture notes.One thought comes to mind when I think of PJ: What is life? This man simultaneously does not care about his class while still enjoying his class more than anyone else in the lecture. Although his lectures are truly incomprehensible, I think we should give him a break -- he is only super ten year. I can only hope to be as cool as him one day.While he&#39;s not the most engaging professor, Crane did a fairly good job of teaching and explaining the course material which was pretty abstract at times. His tests were rough but graded with leniency, and his office hours were helpful especially before exams.Professor Crane is awesome.  He isn&#39;t always the most interesting lecturer, but if you pay close attention in class you&#39;ll be fine. We didn&#39;t use the textbook at all. Exams are ridiculous, but curved nicely.  Office hours are a must! He&#39;s so helpful in office hours.lectures were extremely tedious at times, and often unnecessary. He posts all the lecture notes online, so really, if you are good at absorbing material by simply reading through it, you can save yourself a lot of time. That&#39;s not to say that the lectures were pointless, he does get the point across well in lecture. Tests are a killer, but curvedYour average Chem lecture, though he tries to keep it interesting with experiments and videos every once in a while. Very nice professor but his exams are super difficult! You will find yourself hoping to get 60 out of 120 points. Study up and read the book!did not learn a thing. horrible lecturer. tests are impossibly long but not too difficult. using his practice hw problems helps a lot with tests.The course content is boring, but he tries his best to make it interesting by including demos and interesting examples. He sometimes gets too theoretical, but most of the time explains things well. The tests are really hard, but they are curved. The textbook was really boring, and didn&#39;t really line up with the curriculum well.OK professor. He teaches the material but not much more than that. Lectures are rather boring, but if you listen you&#39;ll be fine. Also the Labs don&#39;t line up with lecture material which is annoying. If you read the textbook and do your homework seriously, though, you&#39;ll be able to get above the mean on the tests which are rather difficultOH MY GOD!  Professor Wolczanski is freaking amazing!  This guy must know everything possible about his field.  He&#39;s the Wayne Gretsky of organometallic chemistry.  Anyone who has Professor Wolczanski is amazingly luckyAvoid this guy! Lectures became useless very quickly. Teaches further than the curriculum requires. Makes a attempts at joking around during class, especially when it comes to bad grades. Prelims are OK if you study extension problems on HW... however, the Final was madness. Says he is an exceptional teacher, and that&#39;s why he &#34;gets the big bucks&#34;To start, he&#39;s a nice guy but a terrible teacher. He teaches new stuff in a too complex manor such that you walk out of lecture learning nothing. He always says he&#39;ll assign a &#34;very short&#34; problem set, yet every time he says &#34;very short&#34; it ends up being the longest one we&#39;ve done thus far, and keeps getting longer. The tests are impossible too.Not so great teacher, lectures are not very useful for doing well on exams. However, lecture attendance is mandatory because of random recorded polls he does during class (and even after class ends). Learned mostly by doing homework on Sapling Learning, honestly pretty helpful. Would not take again, but not much choice.He&#39;s actually the worst teacher I&#39;ve ever had. Showed up to lectures, took notes, and payed close attention to what Marohn was teaching. I ended up doing poorly on Prelim 1. Then, I stopped going to lecture\/self-studied the course for the 50 minutes during lecture and ended up above the mean on Prelim 2. If you get him as a professor I am SO sorry.Here&#39;s the advice to get through.  Go to all the lectures and read his notes before class (class has more meaning this way), thoroughly do the problems.  to study make sure you know every lecture and every extension by heart.  I promise if you do this you will beat the curve on every exam.It&#39;s gen chem. You will not enjoy it unless you have prior experience, and he doesn&#39;t make it easier. Just read the textbook do the Sapling and practice exams and hope for the best. Learning proofs is useless unless you&#39;re THAT passionate about chem bruh.His tests are extremely hard, but are curved. His lectures are boring, convoluted and hard to understand. I recommend reading the textbook chapter before the lectures and problem sets.Definitely my favorite professor and favorite class this semester. His lectures were very focused, and he took care to fully explain everything. Office hours were very useful to refresh your memory. Homeworks and prelims were very fair as long as you kept up with the material. Overall a very organized, approachable, and awesome guy.His lecture is completely useless and totally ruined my interest for chemistry. If you must gain credit for chemistry, take the placement test and avoid this guy if it is possible! Prelims and final are kind of irrelavant to the course material.Not an interesting class and his lectures put me to sleep. The textbook used was terrible and a waste of money (and time if you read it). The only good part about the class that I could see was that a TA took pretty good notes and posted them on blackboard. Early labs were ok then they trailed off.He&#39;s very smart and enthusiastic about chemistry, but he gives his lectures under the assumption that you already understand the material. Instead of explaining any concepts, he just does proofs or works examples without explaining the general principles behind them. I stopped going to lecture and ended up learning everything through the textbook.I would have done better in the class if I had just skipped lectures and only read the textbook and reviewed past exams. His existence discouraged me so much I literally lost all motivation to study for the class. He doesn&#39;t care about students, his class is extremely disorganized, and he arrived to every class late (even though they were online!)Lectures were not useful. Tests were hard and too long for the allowed time. Homework was fair, but learn the material from the textbook because it&#39;s not covered in lecture.BADHe is a very entertaining lecturer, but his lectures are very confusing. He moves too fast, and doesn&#39;t explain concepts well at all.I am so bad at chemistry but Dr. Lorey really helped me grasp the concepts that were challenging. The class requires work to be put in but if you complete the assignments and come to lecture, youll do just fine. 2090 in the summer is a great class to take for those struggling with gen chem in the fall or spring","difficulty":4.01,"rating":2.05},{"index":1254,"prof_name":"Peter Wolczanski","prof_dept":"Chemistry","class_name":"CHEM211","comment":"It was the material that this course covers that is very difficult (take 207), not the teacher. Although the professor was not overtly enthusiastic, he was by no means Evil or sadistic, he just did his job and that is why he is only a mediocre professor.Worst professor possibly imaginable for a freshman chemistry course. Boring, teaches irrelevant material, disorganized, rambles, and basically makes the class seem this arbitrary collection of material. (Teaching semiconductor physics to freshman engineers for no reason? WHY?)What can I say... He is a nice guy and has nice handwriting...I personally used his lecture as a lunch break. His lectures don&#39;t cover the exams well so you&#39;ll be hitting the textbook up. He also makes you memorize equations instead of learning concepts.I really think John Marohn&#39;s a good guy.  I just HATED his lectures.  I could rarely stay awake through his rambling and, when I did, ended up with pages and pages of useless notes.  The only incentives to EVER going to lecture are his goofy jokes and ocassional volatile experiments.potentially interesting class, material is covered at a relatively fast pace. knowing chem beforehand would be helpful; i didn&#39;t take chem since freshman year of high school and i got above the mean on the prelim, so it&#39;s not too hard.Fun guy who knows his stuff. However, tests and homework are sometimes very hard.Worst teacher I had at cornell. Mean on tests = 40% You don&#39;t learn anything. Its all about competition. Take 207 alternate chem course - will not affect your engineering standing at all.While demonstrating wave propagation with a long slinky: &#34;I&#39;m a married man, so I haven&#39;t had much practice with my hand.&#34; --Wolczanski... these are the only words I remember from his course.Entertaining lecture, great guyAbsolutely Evil man.  His only interest in teaching is so that he can prove he is smarter than his students.  Steer clear at all costs.  Avg test scores of 41%When taking the final, everyone opened up to the first page and the entire room started laughing... there is no way this man should be teaching.  absolutely horribleSteer Clear of this class at ALL costs.  Take the alternative chemistry for engineering majors (207?).  You will be happy you made the choiceMEAN MAN. He is the epitome of a Cornell professor who cares more about his research than the students. Even the TA&#39;s for the course could not do some of the exam questions. Why is it necessary to trick students when we are here to learn &amp; graduate? Whe teaches VERY FAST and too much in one semester-- he may go into too much depth...  but hes a funny old man, and a good professor i gotta hand it to him, hes really smart and knows his stuff.He teaches way too much material at too high a level.  I retained nothing I &#34;learned.&#34;No Commentseeeeeeeeeeeeeeevilwell yeah maybe if you haven&#39;t taken any chem in HS after 9th grade it will suck but i took AP chem in 11th grade and got a 2 on the AP test but i got an A on the 1st prelim and i`ve done almost all the labs back in HS but other than that i still read the book. He gives you all the info u need to know in class and is very helpful after class.crane is my dogg. hes a good prof, exams may be tough but what do u want. explains things clearly. writes everything o n blackboard...\n \n YOU MY BOY CRANETry to avoid this class at all costs. It might just be the hardest class you will ever take at Cornell. Lectures are extremely boring. Tests are insanely difficult (especially the final). I think Crane killed the last bit of interest that I had left of Chemistry.given the amount of material he has to teach in a given time, he does a good job. going to office hours often helps clear up confusing lectures.i took this class purely becoz i&#39;m interested in the material covered. However, Prof. Marohn disappointed me with his ill teaching: he speaks fast often without looking at the students, covers lots of topics each week and most prelims are virtually the duplicates of the past prelims. sighTeaches over the students&#39; heads a lot of the time, but he knows his stuff.  Lectures were confusing and often boring, but the demonstrations were fun.  Nice guy with good intentions; he&#39;s just not as clear as he could be.He&#39;s a fun guy and makes the class fun, but his lectures are not very well tied to the book and are too complex many times.Never teaches anything, just regurgitates examples from textbook and doesn&#39;t explain anything.  Don&#39;t go to his lectures and just read the textbook, it&#39;s a better use of your time.lectures were extremely unhelpful work was tough and  so were the prelims. fair curve thoughHe needs to speak more to the student body instead of talking out loud to himself.Good lecture, done with a sense of humor.  Tests were a bit hard.Tests were hard, but he&#39;s a good lecturer.the final was indeed ridiculous, but lectures, hw, and labs weren&#39;t that bad. chem sucks less with zaxCool prof-  very helpful, blows stuff up in classSometimes goes off on derivations and stuff you don&#39;t need to know in class, but class is pretty good overall.  Very helpful during office hours and does cool demos.Very good professor.  Sometimes lectures on things that are somewhat unrelated, but as long as you can tell what he is actually going to test you on it will be ok.  Chem 211 was basically the same exact chemistry course I took sophomore year of high school, so not too hardThe previous reviewer is 100% right.  Sure Chem 211 is a tough class, but its not because Crane can&#39;t teach.  I thought he tried to make it as interesting and relevant as possible, and if people in the class paid more attention maybe they&#39;d realize this as well.  He moved fast but was generally clear and helpful.Sure you may get a 50 on a prelim, but it&#39;ll be a B+. The class is hard but thats because half the kids don&#39;t give it a legitimate shot, Crane lectures to a primarily deaf audience. Pay attention and you&#39;ll be fine.lots of work but a very good prof. great demos. go to his office hours very helpful will try to answer any of your questions. nvery nice guy fair prelims - not to bad if you study well good curve tooNo CommentsNo CommentsDefinitely need to sit up front so it&#39;s easier to understand him but otherwise great prof.  Very fair prelims.hardest class at cornell....crane spoke too fast and did not prepare for prelims or final....the tests are too hard with means in the 30&#39;s.....BEWAREhorrible teaching style, horrible courseHorrible experience. Crane does not explain concepts well. There are times when most of us are comepletely lost in what he&#39;s saying. This class really gives you pain.. I got a 4 on AP Chem exam and the fact that I&#39;m taking this class right now makes me wanna kill myself.He gets into complex derivations that you&#39;ll never need to know, the class was very unorganized, lecture notes did not help at all (i never even looked at them while studying), he didn&#39;t really care much about the students, made a lot of false promises (ex-he posted a study guide the day of the prelMostly teaches well, sometimes difficult to understand. Helpful if doing poorly: large curves on prelims. Go to AEWs if having trouble. Tests of average difficulty: study!sometimes can&#39;t understand what he&#39;s talking about but really cool demosAlthough it is traditionally seen as a tough class, it is not that tough actually. He gave final grade pretty leniently!Good teacher; hard to hear sometimes due to room acoustics; great in-class expirements and exams were both reasonable and comprehensive.Makes lectures and material very interesting.

He loves to do demonstrations in class; any day we dont blow something up is a day wasted in his eyes. He is obviously loves the material he is teaching and the feeling transfers to his students. It is a difficult class though.Great professor, amazing lecturer, and great class.  He really made me interested in chemistry.  Tests are very difficult, but fair in general.  He seemed to become more patient with answering questions towards the end of the semester.A couple years out, I now realize he is just an entertainer, not an scholar. Hopefully he matures into a real educator some day.A funny teacher, but sometimes takes time from class telling jokes and goes off topic. The demonstrations are always fun and his sense of humor keeps students awake in the morning. The labs for the class are hard and the tests are even harder, but the curve is generous. However, intense studying is required and the problem sets are sometimes hard.Problem sets can be daunting, TA office hours are incredibly helpful. Problem sets are often not as hard as they appear, sometimes just weirdly worded. Funny guy during class, keeps it interesting. Sometimes doesn&#39;t give examples which makes it hard to know how to apply some information, but generally a good professor.Great professor. Very clear and very funny. I loved going to class cuz Chirik was interactive and friendly and the material was interesting. One of the best lecturers I have seen. If you want to learn chemistry (thermo, kinetics, etc.) start with chem 215, esp with Chirik.Problem sets were confusing, exams even more so. Lectures mostly consist of him deriving formulas on the board. This class convinced me not to major in chemistry.Chirik has a great passion for chemistry and relates what he&#39;s teaching to reality.  His tests are very difficult, but they push a student to do their best and then get better.  Chirik expects students to work hard and think and act like scientists.Great personality - cracks a lot of jokes and keeps class interesting, resorting to his humor and many usually awesome demos.  Does a decent job teaching the material, though it isn&#39;t always clear.  TA &amp; office hours help alot.  Workload is reasonable, but prelims are rather difficult.  It&#39;s a good class.Umm... I enjoyed the lectures while i was still in this class. They were really fun and interesting. His prelim was seriously ridiculously hard and because of it I dropped to 207 in the middle of the semester. He doesn&#39;t exactly teach for a test so even if  you think you understand the information you still could have a problem on the prelim.","difficulty":3.7,"rating":3.7},{"index":1256,"prof_name":"John Marohn","prof_dept":"Chemistry","class_name":"CHEM2150","comment":"Lectures were the most useless thing.  He just derives equations which has nothing to do with the tests and doesn&#39;t really help you learn chemistry.Subtly funny. Lectures move quickly, but are interesting and done well. Often goes into a lot of depth on topics(ie derivations),which is interesting but not needed for the exams. Exams aren&#39;t that hard,but theres no time on them(final was fair). IMO, if I took regular chem, I&#39;d have gotten an A,but Im glad I took this class (reg chem is boring)The prelims were extremely hard. But dont worry, the curve is fair. Overall his class was fun but he could cover things too fast sometimes. Challenge Problem sets were optional. Except you really want an A+, you dont have to do them or read the textbook actually.Teaches the material very well. Often times goes through the material too quickly to get through all of it. He cares about how well you do and explains everything well in office hours, but the exams are definitely difficult. Not too much work, but you have to keep up with readings and studying to do well.His lectures are entertaining, but it&#39;s not really clear how the lecture relates to the book, prelims, etc. He spent a lot of time deriving formulas, which was interesting, but he never really told you how to useapply the formulas and concepts, and since he deviated from the book a lot it got really confusing. Also, the 1st prelim was just hell.Chem 2150 with Wilson was amazing.  From day one, he had the class like O Mg (Oxygen and Magnesium).  He often speeds up near the end of lecture, but is still easy to follow and explains everything.  Labs can sometimes be long, but the in class demos made up for everything.  Must take for pyrotechnics #thermite #oxygen&amp;hydrogen #burningdollas2150 was definitely my favorite class this semester! Prof. Wilson knows what he&#39;s talking about - lectures can be fast, but office hours helped a ton. The labs didn&#39;t get super good until halfway through the semester, but cool demos in lecture, like what was probably one of the awesomest things ever in Baker 200, the THERMITE REACTION *mic drop*Unfair in his dealings with students. Only cares about himself and how he looks to his peers and the administration. Deceptive and dirty. Plays politics a lot.Great person with amazing enthusiasm and dedication. Unfortunately this does not translate into good lectures. If you read ahead of the lectures, you&#39;ll find them much more useful, but even then attendance likely won&#39;t help you solve many problems.Super chill, but not a very good teacher. He is very derivation-heavy, and introduces some irrelevant concepts in the process of these derivations. His CengageBrain homeworks, however, are good preparation for the prelims and final. The class itself was very interesting, but don&#39;t kill yourself over copying everything he writes on the board.Stephen Lee is a very difficult professor and to be quite honeest, I did not enjoy my first semester with him. What I learned the 2nd semester however, was to roll with the punches. His class is a blast because he is such as character- I doubt there is any professor like him. Enjoy the dozens of entertaining stories he will provide you with.I absolutely loved this class and Prof. Wilson. He tended to go very quickly in lectures but was always available in office hours or outside of class to clarify and answer questions. Be sure to do the OWL homework and challenge psets as they will prepare you best for the final. Lab reports are ridiculously long and annoying though. Take this class!Marohn is a great guy and he obviously knows the material well, but he does not do a good job conveying this in lectures. The lectures were very sloppy and confusing, and the expectations for the course were extremely unclear. I pretty much learned the course material through the textbook.A good guy, he really wants you to understand the material, and while he may go too slowly or too quickly in lecture on occasion just be sure to raise your hand and ask questions if you need to.Knew what he was teaching, but was very boring. I mean VERY boring. The pace of the class was very quick too since he covered a lot of material that was not really needed or understandable for introductory chemistry.He is a smart man, this just was not the class for him. It was obviously his first time teaching the material because he could not understand and explain things well.  He thinks in very complex, theoretical terms that have no place in a freshmen gen chem class. He was just not the right professor to teach this class and I feel like learned little.lectures are somewhat hard to follow and heavy in proofs for equations (imo like a physics course); a little boring. fun demos at the end of lecs though. labs are time-consuming (learn to use excel) but easy to get full or almost full points every time. tests are difficult. study assigned psets + old tests A LOT. course curved to B average.He is no doubt a brilliant man.  However, he sometimes has trouble explaining things to the class.  His homeworks were sometimes nearly impossible, so much so that the TA&#39;s couldn&#39;t do them.  Prelims and final were tough but fair.  This class included a lot of demos, which was cool, but very little textbook use.  Great guy, not the best professor.A very helpful professor who is always open to questions from students. He responds to emails quickly. Lectures are also well-organized, (almost) each time ending with an interesting demo. Exams are not that difficult once you practice past prelims and problem sets. Be prepared for the time-consuming lab reports :)If you want to take this class just to have something to look good on your transcript, don&#39;t. However, if you are prepared to work hard, devote a lot of time, and learn how to think differently, you have my highest recommendation. Professor Lee is brilliant, interesting, and caring; though you will not immediately understand everything, keep at it!Did not give enough time to read the textbook pages before assignments were due, even though they were pretty essential to completing the problem sets. Lectured on lots of material which were not covered on prelims or the final. From observation, if you could understand his lectures, you would enjoy them. Otherwise, you would absolutely hate themGreat demos. He is really really into kinetics so if you don&#39;t understand rate laws well you are pretty much screwed. Tries to keep the class interesting, it sort of ran out of steam at the end of the semester, but it is very obvious that his genuinely interested in his students learning and chemistry overall.I want to know where his cartoons went! Professor Davis loves chemistry and it shows, whether he&#39;s randomly firing cannons into the lecture hall or working out the steady state approximation for the tenth time. He explains concepts thoroughly and gives fair exams, not easy, not backbreaking. He&#39;s a really nice guy too!Prof. Lee is a great guy. The first few weeks of the class were honestly bad. However, after having stuck with it I&#39;m glad I did. The work ethic I have now is amazing and being forced to think in unique ways is definitely helping me in my other courses (ChemE). I Really recommend this, just be prepared to work hard and not always understand 100%.His lectures were very interesting. He always has some demos for each of the lecture sessions. He communicates the materials very well to the students. He is also very organized and the exams are reasonable.Great lecturer! Problem sets are a very good indication of exam-type problems. Exams can be a tad bit long, but nothing unmanageable. Helpful during office hours and very enthusiastic and knowledgeable regarding the material. Awesome demos as well.Very friendly teacher. He definitely loves the demos (as everyone else here has commented). His problem sets are a very good representation of the prelims, so if you understand the psets, you&#39;re set. Although I definitely didn&#39;t do well in the course, I&#39;d definitely recommend people to take it (especially if you&#39;ve had AP chem.) You&#39;ll enjoy it!Demos ever lecture, which kept it interesting-- he&#39;s really great at making the material clear if you listen, though I can&#39;t say he&#39;s particularly exciting or funny (you may fall asleep in class). Exams are doable, and the class has a pretty big curve. Lab starts out next to impossible but gets a lot better.Good teacher. Knows his stuff and communicates it pretty well. Tests are fair. Labs are difficult but there is a curve so it&#39;s all good. Funny guy, too, and demos are awesome.Out of all the professors I have had at Cornell, he is honestly the only one I have met that actually cares about his students. He takes so much time out of his out of class schedule to help kids understand the material. The class was definitely a challenge, but when you understand something it really feels amazing.In the first few weeks this semester, people dropped the class like flies. I waited just to give him a chance but just didn&#39;t learn anything at all...My dreams of majoring in Chemistry came to an end after meeting this man.As most people have said, the lectures are standard and the demos are cool. The P-sets really are a reflection of what he&#39;ll put on the tests, so do those (even though they aren&#39;t for a grade). He himself is pretty reasonable when it comes to grades and advice, though he may go over your head if you ask him about other chem topics.This was Marohn&#39;s first semester teaching 2150, so maybe thats why it sucked so much, but YEAH it sucked a lot. His lectures were confusing and didn&#39;t cover what we needed to know for the exams. Lots of unnecessary derivations. So, the book was basically how we learned. Problem sets were a good guideline for the exams.As a ChemE, I was encouraged to take this course, but I must say that it has been a dreadful disappointment. Dr. Lee is a kind man and a genius, but he has absolutely no teaching ability. He thinks in a way that is not conducive to conveying information to others so lectures were a waste and I had to learn it all from the TA&#39;s\/ other professors.Marohn is obviously really interested in what he is teaching. He&#39;s very entertaining and fairly approachable. The problem is that he doesn&#39;t convey the material very well. His lectures could be very confusing and didn&#39;t reflect what appeared on the exams. Almost everything had to be learned from the textbook, which was pretty bad. A+ demos, though.Professor Marohn holds office hours once almost every week but he takes forever and goes out of topic while solving a problem and there are tons of students asking him questions. Labs really are annoying (some of them will be like 8-9 pages). However, tests are curved really generously so if you do +1 SD the mean you will likely get A+ in the coursHe&#39;s a great teacher with a lot of passion for what he does. The demos are all really cool. My favorite class in freshman yearCame into this class as a chem major, left as NOT a chem major. His lectures are mostly useless, and it&#39;s much easier to understand if you just read the textbook. TA&#39;s office hours are hit or miss. Prof&#39;s office hours were not really helpful. FYI, do NOT take this class if you aren&#39;t confident in your previous chemistry knowledge!Marohn makes concepts cryptic, whether it be in lecture or OHs. Labs are graded too harshly and take too much time. Passing the tests are manageable if you read the text; lectures are not necessary at all--they can confuse you more. I was considered ChemE, but after this class I (and about 75% of the class) changed their minds.Marohn is a very nice, friendly person. His enthusiasm for the subject is astounding. However, that enthusiasm doesn&#39;t translate well into lecturing and teaching an intro honors chem course. Spent way too much time deriving formulas in lecture. Lectures are hard to follow. If you want to pass DO THE HOMEWORK and really study it.

He&#39;s very intelligent, but he doesn&#39;t realize the material can be difficult to understand.\n All the material in the semester centered around a basic idea taught in the first 4 weeks and if you don&#39;t get this, good luck. go to his extra help sessions and you may understand some of the material.The material is very different from most other classes I&#39;ve taken so far, but Lee does an excellent job going step by step through the process of learning it.  I&#39;d definitely recommend him.This class is much more than any freshman needs. Unless you are a chemistry major and absolutely love chem, do not take this class. He can be quite confusing and there is no point to getting bad grades just so you can say you took an honors class.Professor Lee is incredibly intelligent, but I think at times he overestimates his freshmen class. I learned a lot though. The lecture notes he provided at the beginning of the semester were helpful.The only way you can hope to succeed in this class is by doing the problem sets - multiple times. Also, try to catch him after the lecture and bombard him with questions. Its the only way you can figure out stuff he doesnt explain well in lecture since trying to figure stuff on your own is suicide.Absolutley Terrible.Mmm...can&#39;t say much for his teaching abiliies, but he&#39;s one foxy chemistry professor.Clear, organized lecturer, just a bit dull - a lot of info.

Seems to ramble and assumes you understand everything...stop him, if u can. Clumsy; handwriting impossible; go to TA&#39;s for help if u want to live. Terry rules...go to his OH.Great guy on a personal level, but not exactly in tune with what undergrads can REASONABLY handle academically.EHHH, HE&#39;S PRETTY NERDY ABOUT CHEMISTRY, BUT THAT MIGHT BE BECAUSE HE&#39;S A PROFESSOR.  HE KEEPS YOU AWAKE PRETTY WELL.  ALSO NOTE:  HE SAYS &#34;NU CULE AR&#34; INSTEAD OF &#34;NU CLEAR&#34;.THE STUFF WAS TRANSCENDENTALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DIGEST, MAN!ARRRRRGHHHH!!!!!!! So... evil....maybe if i actually looked at the board....Has the potential to be a good teacher but is still a bit green.  In a few years he will be a better prof.Amazing teaching style: exploratory and emphasizes self-discovery in a comfortable environment. Exactly what college courses should be like.The lectures weren&#39;t bad. The problem sets were alright. The tests were a bit extreme. Just go to Terry for Office Hours. I couldn&#39;t seem to find Crane most of the time.This man is crazy, but he&#39;s great at what he does and is dedicated to helping you understand it. He wrote the textbook--sure it&#39;s incredibly confusing and he really pushes you to think, but his exams are much more straight forward. Homework groups and weekly problem sessions highly recommended.After Chirik, I had hopes that 216 would be just as interesting and Lee ruined it for me. His lectures are useless and his explanations incomprehensible. I was perpetually confused in this class and his problem sessions just made it worse. The tests are not an accurate portrayal of the class (which can be good or bad). Thank god for John Terry!Lee definitely knows his stuff and is a great scientist.  However, this class was definitely a let down after Chirik&#39;s Chem 215 class.  I don&#39;t think I will ever use the stuff he taught us.  We went so indepth that it became basically useless.  Tests are fair though and you can do well in this class if you study.  Go to problem session.That 5-o&#39;clock shadow&#39;s there by noon, he always has chalk on his pants, and always something funny to say. Just not experienced. Just doesn&#39;t care.

Love it or hate it.Since this class is no longer being offered, comments on the class will be omitted.  Professor Lee is brilliant, however sometimes he has difficulties communicating his knowledge to you in a comprehensible way.  His exams are very tough, but generally fair.

If you liked 2160 you will love 4300.Also tells the best storiesThe class was extremely confusing, but Stephen Lee cares about his students and really wants everyone to understand the  material. The problem sessions definitely help. His prelims were fair.This class is modeled after him. He writes a textbook by hand and then lectures off of it. SL is incredibly smart and cares about his students, but is difficult to understand and the material is beyond even the TA&#39;s.

Although sometimes unintentionally arrogant, he gives funny and informative lectures about labs, even if these lectures include two blackboards worth of reactions and formulas he expects you to copy down and memorize.  His final exam is one of the most ridiculous, difficult tests I have ever taken.Wish he taught mechanisms better--the final exam killed my grade.the class in general isn&#39;t too bad. you&#39;ll probably never get out of lab early but you definitely do enough of them to feel you&#39;ve learned something at the end. try to find a good TA and ask them everything that isn&#39;t explained in lecture, because ruttledge does very little actual teaching.Dr. Ruttledge is extremely self-absorbed, which bothered me on a personal level. HOWEVER, he does give engaging lectures, and he knows his stuff. Lab practical will make you poo yourself because its somewhat out of your control. Final is not that hard if you actually study the lab mechanisms. I got an A on it and I&#39;m an avgbelow avg chem student Makes a 2 credit intro organic chemistry lab course way more work than it needs to be. Felt like lectures were always behind schedule and that there was a huge discontinuity between what was going on during the lab sections and what was going on in class. I don&#39;t care what you did in Ghana or Paris, I care about learning the material.For 2 credits, 2510 is a lot of work (10 hr\/wk), but that means it affects your GPA less.

Don&#39;t freak about the practical, but prepare. Study a LOT for the final exam.Ruttledge is a pretty funny professor and good lecturer. The lab practical went ok for me, but you have to be VERY careful. Final was ok, but I think it&#39;s a lot better if you take it with or after orgo 2 (makes studying for this easier). Lab Report grading was highly variable, depending on your TA. Overall, it&#39;s a decent class.PRAY TO GOD NOT TO GET THIS PROFESSOR EVER AGAIN!!!!Annoying. Not necessary to have both a lab practical and a final but regardless neither of them were too difficult.I did not enjoy this class at all. If you&#39;re not a solid chem student, Professor Rutledge will make you feel like an idiot. He is very arrogant. I personally did not like his teaching style at all. He can be funny, but he is full of himself. I do not recommend at all.Really recommend that you take this along CHEM3580, or after CHEM3580 if you can. He&#39;s always behind in lectures. Study the prelab very well and make sure to complete each objective to get the lab notebook points in the end. This course will take so much of your time so if you can take it in the summer I highly advise you to do just that.You&#39;ll never have a boring lecture in any of Ruttledge&#39;s courses.  His lectures are fun to go to, and if you pay attention you&#39;ll do great on the written test.  As for the practical make sure you know what you&#39;re doing during the weekly labs!  Ask Ruttledge questions when he comes into your lab too, he&#39;s very helpful.Cynthia took over orgo lab last semester after Prof Ruttledge had to take a leave of absence and she was amazing. Her lectures were very entertaining and her sense of humor was on point. She taught everything that we needed to know for the final during lectures and was very fair when writing the final. Its sad that others wont have her for lab.just hope you get a good TA who can clear things up for you. ruttledge spends so much time in class telling jokes that it makes you wonder if he&#39;s killing time due to a lack of command of the material. also, much of his &#34;humor&#34; is quite offensive.Tom does not believe in easy. He wants student to work hard for their grade, and it shows. He tries to help student by being tough but sometimes it backfires. The grading of the class rests on the TA mostly. Don&#39;t worry about the practical because there will be a review session and lots of extra help. It is also helpful to take 3580 for the final.Everything was fine until the final. There isn&#39;t really a textbook so if you skip the lectures and miss the mechanisms you&#39;re screwed. He likes to hear himself talk but he can be pretty funny. TAs are chill and just as frustrated with Tom as students were. Office hours were not too helpful, he didn&#39;t seem to want to give any straight answers.Incredibly charismatic lecturer and definitely one the more amusing professors I&#39;ve had in Cornell. The material itself is not difficult esp if you took orgo I but can be overwhelming if you don&#39;t know how to multi-task and organize your time well. I suggest scheduling the lab after lecture bc stuff taught in lecture are very useful for lab.So crystal clear! I wish I&#39;d taken this class last semester. He makes IR spectra super clear, and he and the TA&#39;s make mechanisms waaaay easier that Ganum ever did. Everything seems so much easier when Ruttledge explains it. Also, his grading policy is more than fair. I loved this class (and hate orgo)I loved Ruttledge! He is a comedian and always makes a ton of jokes that make lectures enjoyable (just remember: carbocations are prostitutes). The lab practical wasn&#39;t bad, just stressful. The worst part was the final since it was the first written exam of the year. But he always stops by your lab section is is ultra helpful!Congratulations! If you&#39;re reading this, it&#39;s because you won Kyle for your instructor. Kyle is great at answering all questions, as in-depth as you want, and super clear and easy. Kyle could write his own textbook &#34;Chemistry for People Who Aren&#39;t Good at Chemistry&#34;. He is super clear and cheerful. Prepare to work SUPER hard, though! He expects it!Engaging lecturer. Practical and final exam were very difficult, but reasonable. I appreciated the focus on understanding WHY rather than pure memorization of the material. I found office hours helpful, though he makes you work for answers. I feel like he really cares about students and their success, but certainly wants to challenge them.He is entertaining but was not a good professor. From my experience and those of peers-there was no reason to ask for help, he treated us unfairly (ie not following through when he said he would for certain circumstances). I love Orgo and did well in lecture but Professor Ruttledge made Orgo lab unbearable. Take Orgo lab somewhere else.Fantastic professor. Some may find him a bit vulgar though.His lectures are easy to follow and make a lot of sense, so his final seems a lot like a punch in the teeth. He is great for seeking anwers during office hours and has interesting ways of explaining difficult concepts. Also, very funnyorgo lab lecture was the highlight of my week, too bad I suck at all things chemistry-related.  Ruttledge is definitely 1 in a million.This man gives good exams that actually test your understanding of the material rather than regurgitating exams from past years. In reality there are only a handful of mechanisms he can ask, so it shouldn&#39;t be an issue for someone who&#39;s taken 2 semesters of orgo already. If you&#39;ve only taken 3570 then it&#39;s a little extra work but pays off in 3580.He does 2 things: 1) tell inappropriate jokes and 2) complain that students leave the lectures too soon.  Very entertaining, but not useful from an educational standpoint.","difficulty":3.8928571429,"rating":3.2142857143},{"index":1261,"prof_name":"Thomas Ruttledge","prof_dept":"Chemistry","class_name":"CHEM257","comment":"Has great enthusiasm.

In addition to having enthralling lectures, he was a presence in the lab and helped whenever asked, and oftentimes before asking.  I wasn&#39;t a big fan of orgo in general, but I couldn&#39;t have loved orgo lab any more.This was the first lab I ever looked forward to coming to.

He made organic my favorite class of the semester.  Now that I am in 358, I hate orgo and want to go back to 357.Ruttledge is entertaining but I don&#39;t attend Orgo lecture to be entertained. He often breezed too fast through material and gave bad notes. Not to mention we were often behind because he told too many jokes instead of just teaching sometimes.\n I would rather be bored and at least get the material.Ruttledge got me through orgo.  Sure his jokes make you want to squirt him with a powersoaker sometimes but they kept me awake (which says a lot).  Do the practice problem sets and all the practice problems from the book; skim the book chapters and GO TO LECTURE because he covers stuff not in the book.  Great professor.very funny, but lectures are totally confusingThis man is very good at seducing many students, but overall one of the worst profs I ever had. 1 He spends half the time telling OK jokes,  but that&#39;s not why I go to class. 2 When he DOES teach, he rushes through everthing without ever thoroughly explaining ANYTHING! Many other reasons...avoid himlectures.....really entertaining...but useless especially if you could use the extra sleep..go to his office hours, he explains things much better there....and beware of his exams...he like nomenclature too much and reaction mechanisms involving steriochemistry maps...boooContrary to the myths you might have heard. This is by far the easiest class at Cornell. Easy A+, no work, don&#39;t even gotta go to lecture. You don&#39;t even need 207-208 knowledge for it. I took AEM 101 and cooking in the hotel school, and those were 100 times harder than orgo.Prof Coates is my favorite teacher at Cornell so far.  He was a great guy and teacher.  He genuinely cared about teaching the students and has a great personality while lecturing. =)  Very much recommended for Orgo.He&#39;s the best teacher I&#39;ve had at Cornell by far. Go to lectures, do all assigned problems and you&#39;ll do okay. He&#39;s extremely helpful and funny. Give him a chance!He was the absolutely worst professor I have ever had at Cornell.  Half of his lectures don&#39;t even pertain to what we&#39;re learning (no one cares about your cat with one eye or how you won&#39;t make it to Zimbabwe because of an exam, Ruttledge - aren&#39;t you supposed to teach?). He is also very conceited and is not at all open to people who need help.He&#39;s not a real professor but he likes to pretend he is; except in that he doesn&#39;t actually teach anything during lecture and spends a majority of the time telling self-aggrandizing stories and\/or inappropriate jokes. If you&#39;re just looking for a grade you might like his class, but if actually need to learn the material take it from someone else.Entertaining lecturer, keeps you interested and prevents you from zoning out, but sometimes gets a little off track... STUDY for prelims, are difficult, but manageable. He&#39;s not kidding when he says he will push you, but if study enough, tests are manageable. Textbook complements lectures EXTREMELY well- be sure to do the readinggreat lecturer. knows exactly what he&#39;s talking about. his exams are hard though and you will work your ass off to get a b-. make sure to actually study for the exams and go to office hours AND do the suggested problems.Prof. Ruttledge is the hardest teacher I&#39;ve ever had at Cornell. He&#39;s also the best one I&#39;ve had. His exams are brutal but I learned more than I ever thought possible. Organic chemistry is a million times easier after taking his class. To do well, make sure you understand the basics. Go to office hours frequently and do all the problem sets.I thought he was an okay professor. I enjoyed going to class because it was always entertaining, but there were definitely times when he should&#39;ve been providing more details and explanations for the material as opposed to getting sidetracked on a story. you definitely have to work hard in this class or you will fail.Good Lecturer, willing to help students (even holds many extra office hours and about 2-3 review sessions before exams). Orgo isn&#39;t really that hard if you take advantage of the optional problem sets, the office hours and when you actually pay attention in lectureEnthusiastic, interesting professorThe class is quite tricky.  I say lectures are most useful so you know what part of the text book you need to and don&#39;t need to read.  But to be fair, he is very helpful and friendly.  Pretty good prof, if he cuts back on the jokes a bit.QUE HORIBLE! Tells jokes... too bad Orgo isn&#39;t stand up comedy. Tests are way too long, way too hard, and he&#39;s really morbid and jokes about death and Helen Keller a lot. Too bad I&#39;m not kidding about his inappropriatenesshard as hell but makes class enjoyable. insanealthough lectures are interesting... his jokes make it hard to focus on the material entirely. he makes way too many jokes mixed in with the material. i go to class to learn, not to hear jokes. i wish he would keep them apart so that it would be easier to take notes. tests are also trickymy superhero!Some think he isn&#39;t funny, but the jokes get you throught orgoRuttledge is great.  His jokes may make you roll your eyes but he makes organic chemistry as fun as it can be.  He was awesome about grading things fast.  And he underestimates your grades on prelims which is a nice suprise at the end.  Loved him.  Organic not so much.Great Teacher. Jokes are pretty funny, but don&#39;t forget the class is really really hard. He is very clear and seems to love teaching. Awesome guy.He&#39;s an alright teacher, but he tries to make too many jokes that aren&#39;t funny at all.  Then he says something like &#34;am i talking to myself?  is anyone awake?&#34;  I mean.  Who wants to laugh at stupid jokes.  We&#39;re at Cornell, not some stupid school that laughs at dumb jokes.  Make intellectual jokes.By far, the best professor I ever ever had at cornellreally funny in a dorky wayRuttledge is the worst teacher I have ever had in my life.  He acts all nice when you are in class, but beware if you have a problem and approach him during office hours...jerk to the nth degree.  The tests are hard, and you don&#39;t have enough time to take them.  To sum up in one word...sucks!Prof. Ruttledge is one of the most fluid and impressive lecturers at Cornell.  He knows his stuff cold and expects you to as well.  He is not lying when he says his exams will &#34;push you a little bit.&#34;  Excellent professor overall.  I highly recommend him for students who legitimately want to learn Organic Chemistry.Ok, this class is not easy, only relatively easier than other orgo classes. His lecture&#39;s lack depth, but is uncannily to the point. I can&#39;t judge how he teaches. I CAN tell you that you will be laughing your butt off for at least a month. He&#39;s the funniest guy on campus, and it helps u concentrate.Awesome!My favorite quote from Geoff:  &#34;Put the strap on, do the reaction.&#34;  :)My favorite professor at Cornell. I was absolutely TERRIFIED of organic chemistry last year, but Ruttledge made the subject entertaining and comprehensible. He pushes you to your limits and exams are difficult, but you come out of the class with such a solid foundation that&#39;ll benefit you on the MCAT. You might hate him, but you&#39;ll miss him.i actually liked the class and the book. prof hines seemed interested in answering questions in class and in office hours. the class was tough but fair, my experience was that the chem students did better than the chemE&#39;sThis guy is the bomb. Thought I would die in Orgo because all the premeds made it seem like Orgo was impossible. They&#39;re just dumb. RUTTLEDGE ROCKS! wish he taught 358 :(I thought he was bad when I had him since his tests were difficult, but he was a really good teacher who wasn&#39;t boring at all.  I realized how good I had it when I had Sogah second semester for 358 who sucked a lot.  Ruttledge is good, study and do well when you at least have an interesting teacher.Ruttledge was really cool and always willing to help his students.No CommentsHe was just too silly for me.definitely made orgo worth learning.awful, awful, awful. seriously, even though you can do well.  he is demeaning, wants you to fail with his ridiculous tests, and makes extremely inappropriate and useless jokes.  who cares if he&#39;s funny and entertaining--this is orgo.  we&#39;re not here to be entertained with jokes; we&#39;re here to learn. he&#39;s extremely arrogant.DON&#39;T TAKE THIS WITH HIM!he is one of the worst professors!! his inappropriate comments and his lack of organization is what killed my interest in this class.  i suggest waiting for another professor to teach this course! his exams are brutal!best professor ever in every way.he made orgo funA great course for those students who go to lecture and enjoy the subject matter. He doesn&#39;t really follow the book, but the textbook acts as a great supplement to the course. Practice problem sets and practice exams prepare you well for the exams. He seems to know his material through and through, which is refreshing.He made orgo understandable and easy to learn....and dare I say, fun? The man is nuts about chemistry, but its great to have someone so enthusiastic!Seems nice at first but his jokes aren&#39;t so funny after the first prelim. He seems to enjoy making the course difficult and he doesn&#39;t follow the book frequently so it is confusing of what to study. Huge ego!Hard exams. At times went through lecture material too fast. So-So notes. Practice prelims were not as helpful as they could be because never posted solutions, would not be a problem if class was smaller. A nice guy, although stange sense of humor. Tried to make material interesting.No CommentsGood teacher, is pretty entertaining.  One minor complaint is that he singles out a few students in class that he knows to try to make the class more personal, but it instead works against him because of issues (ie: favoritism).  Overall, gives great lectures and is pretty entertaining.Nice guy. If you make an effort to seek help we will  provide it. While he does tell a lot of jokes in lecture, he does it so that he does not go over the material too fast for students to be able to grasp everything that he is saying. Nonetheless, his tests are very hard and purposely deceptive.Ruttledge is a horrible professor.Earlier comments about how he favors people is TRUE.The only reason why I am posting this late in the semester is because I thought I can give him a chance, but he is pure evil.THe good comments were probably his suck-ups or even himself cause he is that pathetic.My worst professor at Cornell.  If you ar having trouble in his class and ask for assistance\/guidance, be careful.  He makes you think he is on your side but he is not.Professor Ruttledge was a good lecturer but thats about it. He was not at all helpful in office hours and sometimes really rude. He totally plays favorites. His jokes get really old really fast.Great Prof. really loves what he does, cares about student. But the course is definitely a lot of work but everyone knows that going in.Ruttledge is Awesome!I was dreading Orgo, but Ruttledge&#39;s craziness made the class fun and interesting.  One of the best professors I&#39;ve come across, though his tests are pretty tricky.Instead of making stupid noises and bad jokes he should have actually tried to teach the material.Took us into the light and stopped feeding us crap.Ruttledge might be the worst, most unfair professor I&#39;ve ever heard.  He doesn&#39;t teach during lecture, and when he does there are important inconsistencies between him and the textbook.  Also, he refuses to meet with you unless you sit in the front row and he knows your name.He is the greatest!!Good at managing large class size.

He really tests on the material he taught us. Best chem prof yet!!I love his lectures, so easy to follow.  He&#39;s so willing to help the students, not bring them down like some premed courses do.  I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s a good person, though, after a certain incident in lecture.  But, that doesn&#39;t affect his teaching.  He&#39;s a great TEACH-er.The funniest class I took. Not because he&#39;s funny, but because he managed to cover up for all the mistakes he did during class by affecting a &#39;i knew that&#39; attitude. His tests were so simple (at least, the first two were...). TA&#39;s are extremely helpful to go to. Homeworks were annoying hard at times. Class is overall easy.PROFESSOR COATES IS THE BEST SCIENCE PROFF I HAVE HAD EVER ! he makes the classss sooo much fun .. he is a kind guy with a lovely personality .. he is extremely helpful in any way and cornell is luck to have him ! i luv organic chem cause of him . his test are VERY FAIR .. and yes.. if u think they are hard,,, u need to be working harder!Ok, so I didn&#39;t expect to be entertained by Coates as I was in 357, 358 was what I originally expected from an orgo class. dull sense of humor and all, he was extremely organized in presenting material and tests were VERY fair. of course it&#39;s hard... it&#39;s orgo! what do you expect?  Anyone saying his tests were unfair obviously didn&#39;t study enough.Just Awesome!  Study hard and it should pay off.Not a bad orgo prof. His voice is kind of boring and it makes you want to go to sleep. The man does have a thing for polymers and by the end of the course, you&#39;re gonna need to know, like, 600 reactions.Regardless of the professor, orgo is still gonna be hard. So BEWARE of all all these high ratings! Good LUck!Orgo sucks and I hate it but Coates is a good professor and makes it tolerable. He is very clear and is an all around nice guy. Much more organized than Ruttledge.Way easier than any other Chem course! Total &#34;make it easy so they like me&#34; guy.People that say he is a good professor are retarded... he&#39;s obsessed with friggin polymers. I can&#39;t stand his lectures, he&#39;s not funny, he makes the course boring, and his exams suck. I hate this class and I hate him. I miss Ruttledge.Very amusing, friendly professor. His tests were fair, but still very difficult. His lectures were very clear and his demos were awesome. Ganem never had demos...As good as orgo is going to get. Super nice guy as well.Decent professor. not as crazy as rutledge but crazy enough. good guy thoughHes fun and nice. The class is hard.Absolutely great prof. ZVery challenging, but can be conquered if you attend classes and do the homework. Exam averages are ~60 - don&#39;t believe the &#34;too easy&#34; banter!I LOVE GEOFF COATES!I took orgo last year, and I went to coates&#39; last class on slope day to get ****. I gotta say, geoff&#39;s a pretty swell guy and a great teacher. I love how he had fun with the **** kids in class. Keep an eye on this man, he&#39;s a winner.ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS I HAVE COME ACROSS AT CORNELL...EVER PERIOD. HE IS FROM THE WEST COAST, AND HE IS VERY LAID BACK AND COOL ABOUT ORGO CHEM. HE MAKES A USUALLY STRESSFUL CLASS, FUN AND VERY INTERESTING. DEFINITELY TAKE HIS CLASS :)Well, I wouldn&#39;t say this was easy, with exam scores in the single digits. However the tests were very fair, with questins ranging from easy mult choice to nearly impossible &#39;make the molecule&#39;. Lookin back, I feel I learned alot about the stuff around us is made. Coates was very clear about the materialand his expectations. Great course. Nuff saidGood teacher. Puts more emphasis on his teaching than on his research. Nice guy and always helpful.Coates is a great teacher. His lectures are clear, his tests are manageable, and he&#39;s overall a nice guy. Consider yourself lucky that he took over for meinwald.Probably about as good as orgo can be: clear lectures and fair tests. Both in terms of knowledge learned and grades achieved, you get what you put into this class; just study hard and pay attention to lecture. Also seems like a pretty nice person out of class.I have to say that this class was one of the worst I&#39;ve ever taken.I suppose the rest of these pre-meds are rating him well just to be cut throat, but be warned!  He&#39;s an absolutely terrible professor with absolutely no remeeming qualities to him.  His lectures useless and his tests are extremely unfair.  This person should be kept away from teaching at all costs.A good teacher. Not as good as Ruttlege, but his tests were easier (note: this doesn&#39;t mean the curve gets any easier!). Also, he follows the book more consistently than does Ruttlege, which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it. Overall, I really enjoyed him as a teacher, even if he&#39;s not as hilarious as Ruttlege.Clear, concise, interesting lectures. He definitely wants us all to learn the material and do well.very nice guy. almost like a dad. :).lectures are important cause he takes stuff directly offf off them for exams.problem seys are so much earsier then for 357. tests are VERY FAIR and if you think they are hard, then u need to be working harder. seems to be easier than 357. moves slower than 357 . lovely personality !Coates took all the challenge and excitement out of orgo.  His class consisted of memorizing reactions (mostly reagents and products) and spitting them back on the test in an easy, predictable manner.  You&#39;ll like him if you are a typical premed who hates orgo and loves to memorize things and spit them back without really understanding them.","difficulty":3.4,"rating":4.0},{"index":1280,"prof_name":"Brett Fors","prof_dept":"Chemistry","class_name":"CHEM3580","comment":"Professor Fors is AMAZING!! Best chemistry professor I&#39;ve ever had. He truly cares so much about his students and really makes an effort to ensure we understand. He is very organized, and his lectures are easy to followAlthough Fors just started teaching, nearly everyone loved him. His tests are fair, and the materials come directly from the notes. As long as you study, you will get what you deserve. However, he goes through a lot in each lecture so prepare to study ahead of time. He is a gem and will make organic chem actually enjoyable.Professor Fors is a very nice person, and his pros and cons come through being nice. Pro: he is very patient with each question and each student Con: Because he is nice, he is often controlled by the crowd in lectures, problem-solving sessions, office hours, instead of the other way around.Really nice guyFors is a really nice professor, but won&#39;t take any bullsh*t. Both CHEM3570 (Ganem) and CHEM3580 are classes that if you miss lecture and don&#39;t have a friend&#39;s notes, you will fail.What people say about his lectures are true. I came here to warn you-- don&#39;t bother with the textbook. His mechanisms contradict with the textbook&#39;s (and every other online source for that matter) and he docks points for drawing alternative (but correct) mechanisms. He basically lives in his own world of chemistry. Good luck with this class.Easily the worst professor at Cornell. Super arrogant and does not care about students. Begins each lecture by bragging about how great he is. Creates tests that he knows students will do poorly on and is energized by seeing students struggling.Literally one of my fav professors in the chem department by far. He&#39;s caring and is always willing to help. The material isn&#39;t easy, but he made the class enjoyable.Go to lecture! The textbook is useless: frequently has mechanisms contradictory to Tom&#39;s, and Tom gives way more than enough practice. So go to every lecture and pay attention and write down even stuff that isn&#39;t on the board! He explains mechanisms a lot verbally and those explanations may help you understand the material. Do practice problems!!Professor Fors is AMAZING!!! Such a nice guy and he made CHEM 3580 a little more bearable. Material is challenging, but Professor Fors&#39;s exams are pretty fair, and homework grade helps slightly. Definitely need to attend lecture, or at least get good notes. Reading the textbook is helpful too.Professor Ruttledge believes that the Chemistry department has worked hard for students&#39; success. While this might be true in many aspects, he storms toward the opposite direction. For example, he shows little sympathy and respect, such as humiliating a student who scored a &#34;true zero&#34; (actually attempting to take the test and scoring a zero).He is an extremely intelligent professor and obviously knows what he is talking about, but often lacks sympathy for his students. He spends a lot of time telling stories instead of teaching and then rushes through what he was supposed to cover. Despite this, I did think it was a really cool class. Work as many problems and exams as you can.this prof views his role as an enabler, not a gatekeeper. no doubt this is a hard class, but the lectures are clear and organized. the Friday help sessions are amazingly helpful - relaxed informal setting. first exam was more than fair - if you attend lecture and do the homework you should do well. TAs are all very helpful. One of the greatest lecturer who knows the material and knows how to explain them. Never fell asleep because his explanations were golden. And his my advisor and is a very down to earth person. I&#39;m glad I had him for orgo.Arguably one of the best professors I&#39;ve had yet at Cornell. Coates is the man. He is very clear and organized in his lectures (and often funny), and he wants to see you do well. Difficult course in general due to the material, but much more bearable with Coates. Very down to earth guy. I highly recommend him.This class is incredibly difficult, and this is coming from someone who managed to do well in all other pre-med requirements. Be prepared to WORK. This professor doesn&#39;t make the class any easier or enjoyable.This is not a class you take with other rigorous STEM courses. He is too fast, easily distracted, and hard to follow. He can explain things decently, but drawing is essential to this class and his notes are always messy. Do the practice exams and go to problem solving sessions\/OH. If you cannot attend, kiss your grade goodbye. Hated this class.Your grade is determined solely by the 3 prelims and the final (no hw grade). Make sure you go to lectures because sometimes he&#39;ll throw in reactions he talks about in lecture but isn&#39;t talked about in the textbook. He can explain things decently well but like others have said, he wastes a lot of time in lecture telling personal stories.I had Tom for CHEM 2510 and CHEM 3580 in the same semester. He teaches the material very clearly, but sometimes digresses to tell you about his latest trip to Paris or tell you a joke about his mom. However, I think he does that to keep your attention. He will test you on conceptual knowledge and not memorization. Overall, he was a great professor.This had be one of the most challenging courses that I have taken at Cornell. Be prepared to work for your grade every day because if you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll fall behind. You have to do 2-3 hours of orgo every da, whether that be reviewing your notes and doing practice questions. The textbook was helpful in some cases with explaining topics after learnedProfessor Coates is one of the best lecturers at Cornell, and certainly does a great job teaching organic chemistry. He is extremely clear and organized, and is genuinely one of the nicest professors you will meet. His research focuses on polymer synthesis (and he&#39;s extremely good at it), so know those polymers and transition metal catalysts!Was a very interesting professor. While the material is very hard and the tests push you a lot, Ruttledge is willing to help out his students. Go to office hours! He will clear up lots of confusing concepts and provide you with tips and helpful tricks. I had a much better experience than I anticipated with orgo, and it&#39;s because of Ruttledge.Hard professor. Exams had little to do with that he talked about in class. Had to teach myself everything. Had little to no respect for his students.The increase in difficulty from 3570 to 3580 is unreasonably dramatic. You have to study at least 2-3 hours of organic chemistry every single day and attend every problem solving session to be successful. You cannot afford to fall behind a single bit. Don&#39;t listen to other comments saying this class is doable, prepare to work 1000% to have a chanceEnthusiastic orgo professor who loves soap and telling jokes during class. He should have been a comedian as a side career. Overall difficult class but I felt like I learned a lot despite mixed reviews from other students. His exams were designed for less memorization and more for challenging student&#39;s knowledge and giving them novel problems.Great guy - I like how he was always willing to help.

Although Hines&#39; lectures move at a fast pace, she teaches the material well and answers students&#39; questions when asked. The textbook she chose (Metiu) is worthless. Also, learn how to use Mathematica: you won&#39;t be able to do the problem sets without it.No Commentsi heart freedIf there were a more disinterested professor here, Freed would kill him\/her, because i think he loves to be the worst professor EVER at cornell.  Impossible prelims, boring lectures, terrible TA&#39;s...if a visiting student ever saw this class, they wouldnt come to cornell.Freed may be brilliant (google him) but he sucks at teaching and thinks his students are morons. The only reason to go class is so u have some idea where he is in the textbook (which is surprisingly good for how scary it looks.) Read the book, screw Freed, and prepare to be raped on the prelims (especially if u havent taken diff. eqns).Simply terrible.  He ignores questions and never smiles and his exams are completely unfair.  Didn&#39;t learn a thing from this class.Difficult course, but her lectures are really good. Always attend, copying someone else&#39;s notes doesn&#39;t really help in this course. Expect to spend a long time in OH for the problem sets, and have some pretty low means on the prelims. Overall a good course though.He&#39;s a really good lecturer and explains things really well. tests are very similar to homework questions. it&#39;s definitely a good class, if you like chem and physicsAfter taking Chem 390 this past semester, I realize just how lucky I was to have professor hines teach 389:  quantum mech is hard but her tests were doable and lecture notes were extremely clear and useful in preparing for the exams! Good professor..QM is a daunting subject, but in the hands of a lecturer as capable as prof Hines, it&#39;s totally doable.  She was a fantastic lecturer, but definitely take linear algebra either before or during this course.  That saved me more than once.  Class is also geared towards Chem majors rather than ChemE&#39;s, and that was fine with me.No CommentsI&#39;m pretty sure his lecture notes are photocopies of our textbook pages...","difficulty":4.1176470588,"rating":3.0588235294},{"index":1288,"prof_name":"Nandini Ananth","prof_dept":"Chemistry","class_name":"CHEM3890","comment":"Nandini&#39;s lectures were pretty great considering how difficult it is to teach physical chemistry. Problem sets were very difficult, but exams were not terrible. Her office hours are incredibly helpful (when she didn&#39;t cancel them which happened more often than it should&#39;ve). If you pay attention during lecture and read the textbook you&#39;ll be okay.Lectures consistently ran long. Problem sets expected to take at least six-eight hours. One grad TA spent six hours on one of them. First prelim had some unfair questions, but other than that, doable if you know the material. Luckily, most don&#39;t, so the means are pretty low, and since the class is curved to a B+, grades are fairly generous. He makes the class extremely difficult. While his lectures are interesting and he is clearly a very smart guy, his homework questions come out of nowhere and it is impossible to do the homework without spending countless hours in office hours. The TAs are willing to help, but it takes forever to even get help because there are so many people in OH.Professor Loring is an incredible communicator. Lectures were the best I&#39;ve had so far. Even though the class was very difficult and tests very hard, there was rarely anything unreasonable or pointless memorization.    It was a true blessing that he taught the course. I&#39;d love to  have Loring for every Chem classThis was the professor&#39;s first time teaching the course, so some rough spots were to be expected. Lectures ran over time way too often. The homeworks took around 8-10 hours, depending on how well you&#39;ve been paying attention in lecture. First two exams were pretty brutal with averages being 50%, but the final was relatively easy.Her lectures are one of the best at Cornell. Very clear and well organized. Problems sets are hard. you must go to office hours for help. The Prelims have low means. good class overallLectures were great. Homework is hard as are exams.Professor Loring is awesome. He knows how to make even the most complicated topics at least palatable and interesting. He&#39;s one of the smartest professors I&#39;ve had. You&#39;re lucky if you have him.He knows his material like the back of his hand, AND he knows how to teach with a clarity and precision that not many professors can achieve. He&#39;s very easy to get along with and extremely helpful during office hours. He&#39;s definitely someone you should get to know if you&#39;re a ChemE or Chem major.Loring goes through the material so clearly and knows his stuff. Material is insanely hard that you will get lost but the homework tries to reinforce the key points though it will take you hours (or days). Tests are challenging but fair and tests concept, almost zero memorization.I LOVE NANDINIProfessor Ananth is the perhaps best chemistry professor Ive had at this school. Her lectures were so much fun, she makes the material so interesting, and she really stimulates interest and makes class and learning the best time. I absolutely would take a class with her again, and I would recommend her as a lecturer to any other students.Class is really hard, but he prepares you well. Homeworks often take upwards of 5 hours bare minimum. Speaking from experience, prelims are sort of similar year to year so you can get some insight from previous prelims, but the best way is definitely to do a lot of practice problems.She&#39;s an amazing lecturer! The class was difficult but I learned so much! The problem sets were long (2-8 hours each week) and the exams were fair. The problem sets were graded very harshly and were worth 40% of the overall grade, so spending a lot of time on them was definitely worth it. I honestly wasn&#39;t expecting to like PChem so much!Great professor! Challenging homework, but learned a lot! Really entertaining lecturesVery organized and clear. Kept the focus on the important stuff and elucidated it using excellent HW questions. Cannot ask more from an instructor.Was my first course on quantum mechanics and absolutely loved the class. Lecture attendance crucial to understanding the material; found exams to be very straightforward if concepts learned in class were understood. Problem sets are do-able but may require a couple hours to complete.Nandini is a great professor for a tough class to teach. Homework is difficult as are exams, but are fair. Reading the textbook usually helps, and show up to class.

He knows Pchem isn&#39;t the most fascinating subject for many students and tries to insert short stories or interesting applications into lectures. His lessons are well organized, and a decent number of homework questions are a variation of textbook examples. You&#39;d think this man has a pizza place in Brooklyn, not a PhD from Berkeley in Quantum Mechanics. Crazy hard tests, but he made them shorter so that he can get out of campus earlier to his hot date (aka wife).

But I have to agree with one of the other posts here, by the time i got around to chem 410, things had definitely improved. not sure if it was teaching non-freshmen or the subject matter or just a lot of therapy, but whatever it was, it was not too bad.No CommentsIt&#39;s apparent that this guy is in academia to do his research and views teaching as an unfortunate liability of his job. He is often late to class, and wouldn&#39;t lift a finger if it would help one of his students attain a successful career in chemistry. Moreover he is belligerant and heartless, and often embarrasses students who ask questions.Moves very quickly, doesn&#39;t stop for questions, and not much fun to listen to.  Rarely gives you any background info on WHY you&#39;re covering the material you&#39;re covering.  Looking around the room it&#39;s amusing to see so many confounded students.Had him freshman year for 216 and thought he was pure evil.

Lecture boring and confusing, notes illegible, terrible textbook choice.  Excuse me, how are we supposed to do well in this class?  If the MechEs are understanding the same concept better in different class and professor, there is no way this class is too hard for him to teach well.If there is a worse professor at cornell, i have never had him.  This guy can barely talk, let alone explain fluids.  its over halfway through the semester, and we still have no idea when the 2nd prelim is scheduled for.  he is a disgrace to the cheme dept.  aviod this class if at all possible.No one wrote a fluids review? At least I&#39;M trying to help out my future chemE underclassmen.  Anyways, Archer gives you a crap load of notes throughout the semester and blazes through them at light speed.  However, his tests were FAIR (unlike the Hws) and office hours helpful, good teacher more or less, just too much material..Professor Archer is an extremely friendly and helpful teacher. Although fluid mechanics was tough, he made it easier to handle and definitely wants his students to do well. He is extremely fair and devotes much of his time to office hours.

Exams are fair but problem sets are VERY long.  I&#39;m not the biggest fan of fluids, but if you have to take it, take it with Archer.Where shall I begin!  Is it his terrible notations? or his boring lecture?

Her lectures were clear, easy to follow, and helped with the homework and exams. She was helpful outside of class and provided fun and useful extra credit activities. She really wanted to make sure we learned the material and enjoyed joying so.Single handedly one of the most intelligent, understanding professors in the department. Yes, she&#39;s incredibly tough, but she really cares about her students doing well. She can go really fast sometimes in lecture but they&#39;re very well organized and all her tests are very fair.

He is very helpful and a master of his subject.By far the best professor I have had.  She really cares, and clearly understands the material.  She wants students to enjoy the class and do well, and is greatAt first, she was bad, going way too fast in lecture, answering questions as dismissively as possible, and clearly planning the course without ever reading the ChemE curriculum and realizing we haven&#39;t taken Statics or Thermo. She got progressively better over the course of the semester, but continued to be incredibly condescending all year long.Terrible class, the material is very interesting, but Archer completely ruins it. He&#39;s completely disorganized and arrogant, and his tests are very poorly designed, not necessarily hard, just poorly thought out.Good professor. However the homeworks were long and hard. Prelims were open-notes and very doable. However, the TAs tend to be not useful in office hours. Better off going straight to Archer for Office hoursReally stubborn professor. Can&#39;t fade!!!!At first, she was terrible, i.e. she moved too quickly, assumed knowledge we did not have or simply had not used in a long time, and so forth. After receiving criticism, adjusted her style for the class. Willing to meet outside of class for help on homework. Does not post solutions for problem sets, so you&#39;re forced to go to office hours for help.Tough Course, but Awesome Professor. Archer really knows his fluids and is kind.

He doesn&#39;t currently use swords, but lectures are still entertaining. I learned a lot, and, yeah, he does look like Jesus.Spivey is the man for the following reasons: (1)He doesn&#39;t like pointers, so he uses swords instead. (2) His long hair makes him vaguely resemble Jesus, at least from the back of Uris Aud. (3) Each lecture ends with a trippy &#34;Moment of Zen.He looks like Jesus and he knows it! He brings robot toys into class, shows cool videos, and makes demonstrations. Sometimes gets technical, but the tests are always fair. Classes are fun. Workload easy.Take one of the writing sections, if you have a little extra time, because you&#39;ll do more work in total, but you&#39;re almost guaranteed an A (at least in my section we were).  Spivey&#39;s lectures are very entertaining and you will learn a lot.Great professor! He inspired my world. Its a shame he&#39;s leaving next year to California. Funny and enthusiastic. Also easy A.He&#39;s awesome! Extremely clear, endlessly energetic, really bright, and hilarious. His exams are pretty in-depth, but if you study and do the readings you ought to be fine. Cognitive Science 101 was easily one of my favorite classes at Cornell; it&#39;s such a pity to have lost Spivey to UC Merced.Class didn&#39;t quite go in the direction I was hoping - too much philosophy and linguistics.  Makes statistics even more boring than it already is.  Apart from that, nice guy.  Easy class.  Never had to read.HATED this class.  Easily my least favorite class at Cornell.  He seemed to get angry at questions (even of the students were being smart-alecs).  Tests were confusing, lectures unclear, and I felt like he focused too much on the computer science aspect of the subject.  I wish I had never taken it.the class isn&#39;t really as boring as those below me said - the problem is that it would be much better in a 50 minute format rather than 75.  a lot of the material is interesting, tests aren&#39;t bad, and he&#39;s pretty engaging.  the readings are unnecessary and boring - don&#39;t bother.His lectures go by pretty fast, so you have to pay attention and write fast.  On the other hand, his tests are very easy if you study from your notes. It&#39;s worthwhile to get the takenotes for this class.  And then there are the swords, of course. :)His lectures are excellent and clear, and in this particular course he covers an incredibly diverse array of topics while maintaining a clear idea of what they all have in common.  He is also the only professor I&#39;ve ever seen who uses PowerPoint well.His lectures are great although they move really fast.  My one piece of advice...get takenotes and then just sit and enjoy the class.Fun class to attend!","difficulty":2.3571428571,"rating":3.7857142857},{"index":1417,"prof_name":"Michael Spivey","prof_dept":"Psychology","class_name":"COGST102","comment":"spivey has great enthusiasm which is contagious... i now intend to major in cognitive science or some related subject. he is funny, obviously very intellegent and an all around swell guy. take this class! i love going to lecture, no other 1 hr 40 minute class has ever flown so fast","difficulty":3,"rating":4},{"index":1418,"prof_name":"Khena Swallow","prof_dept":"Psychology","class_name":"COGST1101","comment":"Super boring lectures which you are unfortunately required to attend. Easy class with minimal work.This teacher is the absolute worst. She is so boring and just lectures about why the human brain is a computer. Unless you are CS and interested in psych, you will find this class boring. The material is interesting but the teacher makes it boring. DON&#39;T TAKE THIS CLASSWhat a beautiful man. He has such a radiant smile and a goatee to die for.I had Hale for Intro to Cog Sci, and the class was a letdown. Hale killed all my enthusiasm for the material with needlessly technical lectures and a tendency to go on at length about the mundane details of a particular subject while any significance and understanding were lost to the majority of the class. Tests were poorly written as well.This class is not as hard as others described. As an ILR major, I took this class for my distribution req. and actually enjoyed it. I&#39;m not the kind of person that is extremely good at sciences, but I feel like the class is of proper difficulty. To assure you, as for now I have a 90% in this class. Hale is very enthusiastic and a good lecturer.i don&#39;t know anyone that has above a 75% in this class and he hasn&#39;t said the word &#34;curve&#34; all semester. this class is awful.This class is impossible. There is no text book and Hale is pompous. I was intimidated the whole semester and never felt comfortable going to him for help. The readings are dense and the lectures are confusing and unclear. Unless you really love the subject, don&#39;t take this class. I thought it would be a fun\/interesting elective. I was wrong.THIS CLASS IS HARD. there is no textbook and the online readings are very dense and dull. lectures are a must, because without them its really hard to put the readings together. if you aren&#39;t VERY interested in artificial intelligence, this is not the class for you. this class DESTROYED my interest in cognitive science (i was planning a minor)Awesome lecturer. His lectures are very interesting and funny. One thing I love about his class was that it was lecture based as opposed to reading bunch of stuff not even remotely covered in class. If you studied hard and knew the stuff you would beat the mean, if not, you would be f-ed. He curves exams to B\/B- and allows for 3 extra points.He could sometimes be funny and occassionally sparked my interest in lecture. However, most of the time I found both the lectures and the readings boring, hard to get through, and hard to stay awake in. He&#39;s also very unaccomodating with make-ups. Overall, avoid this class if you can.Hale is a great professor, he makes you work and think.  Other people just dislike him because it&#39;s not &#34;an easy do-nothing  A&#34;.  That shouldn&#39;t mean he&#39;s a bad professor though.  He&#39;s also very fair and very clear in what he wants you to know.Great class.  Very clear powerpoint presentation of material.  Professor is helpful and funny at times.  The material is interesting.  Study the powerpoint slides for tests and you&#39;ll be fine.Honestly had no idea what was going on in lectures most of the time. They were barely relevant and pretty poorly executed. Course material was very interesting though, and tests are relatively easy to study for since she posts slides online to look over (you&#39;ll get more looking at them yourself with the textbook than going to lecture).Professor Swallow is passionate and wants students to succeed. Her tests were pretty straight forward and easy. Unfortunately, she is a bit disorganized which was frustrating and getting back test grades took weeks, despite having many TAs.2 prelims and a final, drop lowest one. Some tricky questions, but mostly from power points. Final is cumulative. Three homework assignments, some parts can be tricky but if you go to TA office hours they will help and book will help. Only need to go to class for clicker points. Find book online. Readings help clarify materialThis was absolutely the worst class I have taken at Cornell. Not only is he unable to teach the material at an introduction level, he is rude to students with questions. The TAs don&#39;t approve of his style and most of them are unsure of what he is teaching. I would never, ever recommend this class to a friend. Avoid at all costs.This is the worst class. The material is confusing and innapplicable for an intro class. I dropped it after 3 weeks because it was very uninteresting and confusing.","difficulty":3.7058823529,"rating":3.1176470588},{"index":1419,"prof_name":"John Hale","prof_dept":"Linguistics","class_name":"COGST1102","comment":"HORRIBLE!

She was a great teacher and I enjoyed her lectures. Her textbook was BORING and she did have a lot of reading. The quizzes for the year were fairly easy.

It&#39;s literally been a nightmare taking this class. If this is a required class for you because of your major, switch majors to avoid hell. The trouble of switching majors is worth not taking this class. Class is incredibly boring so its a hike and a half just to make it there in the morning even though attendance is mandatory. The TAs feedback for prelim essays was confusing and not helpful. The professor did nothing to make this better. She doesnt give clear directions and was rude when asked to clarify further on instructions for help.This is one of the worst classes I&#39;ve ever taken. The lectures are so incredibly boring.

I felt my oral communications skills really improved, and she even made me a teaching assistant.  I had incredible fun, and gained confidence as a speaker.  What more could you ask for?I did improve in public speaking but no thanks to the lectures. They were utterly useless. She is quite possibly the most intellectually challeneged professor. Her presentations were horrible and she contradicted her advice as she gave it. The class wasn&#39;t hard but the written test and outside speaker reports were pointless.Anyone who could speak ill about Toni has no soul, she is the nicest, and also one of the most helpful professors I&#39;ve had.  Her class is not &#34;easy&#34; but grades are based on improvement so you will do well if you give any effort at all.Public speaking is something that we will all have to do sometime in our lives. It&#39;s better to not sound like disorganized morons when we do so. This class showed me how to organize thoughts and information and present it thoroughly. Toni is kind to you if you put effort into her class...as almost any professor would be. Take the course.For a public speaking professor, she could work on her performances during lecture. Lectures = repeat of textbook = the entire prelim at the end of the semester. READ the textbook. Put effort into your speech outlines. I hated Public Speaking at the beginning, and enjoyed myself by the end. Useful and valuable, although prof meh.she sucks.  one time she tried to show us a video and it didnt work, so she just stalled for 20 minutes.  then on the comments part of the attendence slip, i wrote &#34;practice video clips before you come to class&#34;.  for a public speaking professor, ive never seen someone so boring in my life.

My public speaking skills definately improved.sooooooooooooooooooooo boring!!! tried so hard not to fall asleep but couldn&#39;t!Toni is an awesome, caring lady.  She was kind in efforts to instill confidence in those with shaky nerves about public speaking.  She wants you to succeed.  Too bad some don&#39;t appreciate her caring and view it as sucking up.

Any of these reviews claiming the class is hard and pointless are clearly from students who love to complain or are dumb. I have learned so much in COMM 2010 and am now a much more confident speaker!I did not have any real big problems with Toni.  Maybe it was because I had a TA who was extremely disfunctional.

Lots of work, but worth it in the end!Excellent professor. Not an easy class, but Neema is very fair. Great class overall.Arbitrary paper grading standards that were &#34;beyond articulation&#34;, would berate the class at any given point for a number of reasons, generally cranky, took an interesting subject and removed any kind of scientific or academic grounding. Worst class I have taken at cornell.Minus whiney students and HORRIBLE TAs, her classes are wonderful but challenging. You learn so much if you actually do the readings (of which there are A LOT). She is VERY sharp, VERY engaging, and assigns fasinating material. I left CRP after that semester, but to me, she exemplified what a professor should be like- sharp and no nonsense.I disagree with the previous comment. Professor Kudva is always willing to help. If you are struggling with your papers, write a rough draft and take it to her. She might be very strict and indeed does not easily give away A&#39;s, but she is not unfair. The main problem is that most students expect to get an A in this 100-level class.Neema makes this class harder than it needs to be, but nevertheless, she is awesome. Despite the horrible TAs I had and the difficulty of the class, everything else was fine. I feel I learned quite a bit.Not good.\n She explains everything unclearly.\n Whenever someone asks a question,\n she doesn&#39;t really answer the right thing...\n and she is very mean...\n The course itself is very interesting,\n but the TAs hate her......\n The workload is definitely not  3-credit like.Decent prof, but you gotta break your back to do well in the class.","difficulty":3.875,"rating":3.875},{"index":1572,"prof_name":"Richard Booth","prof_dept":"Law","class_name":"CRP1100","comment":"Had him for The American City.

Not very hard to pass, but going to class helps. Readings can be interesting, but skim the long ones, of which there are quite a few. Group research paper is not the worst thing in the world, but it&#39;s pretty bad. Good class to take as a pre-req for upper level courses.She really knows the subject matter and has a lot of experience, but that comes out when she is lecturing and you cannot keep up with broad concepts. Classes are fast passed; don&#39;t even try writing everything on the slides down. Understand the readings in depth and use examples from class and you will be alright.The lectures are very repetitive and are given to further specific points. There isn&#39;t much balance of views and much of the class is spent on things that would be obvious to students from the Global South. Most of the grade comes from a large group project, which is a pain in and of itself, and she tries to help but is unclear about grading .Incomprehensible, lacking substance lectures. The tests aren&#39;t bad while the essays are graded by TAs who are instructed to not give many As and Bs.The lectures for this class are super disorganized--she puts discussion questions at the end that &#34;cover&#34; the lecture material but often you&#39;ll find yourself without the knowledge to answer the Qs. Readings are long and not always directly related.\u00a0Few things you&#39;re graded on. Lecture is irrelevant as slides are posted.Challenging but rewarding. Attendance to sections is mandatory make sure you attend. Long interesting readings. She may not seem like it but is approachable and is very knowledgeable. Prelims weren&#39;t hard but grading was confusing. Overall a brilliant course, very interdisciplinary and broad but grounded by group assignment.No notes on slides so you have to pay attention to every word she says, and she always goes after class is over. It feels like she just regurgitates the readings outloud and you can&#39;t skip class because attendence counts. The TAs grade harshly but they&#39;re on your side and will try to help, but Neema expects everyone to be studying all the time.Neema is a great person with an interesting background. She only gives As to people who work very hard, and her readings and assignments are challenging, but if you put in he work, it will be one of the most rewarding, eye-opening classes you will take. Do the readings, show up, put in effort, and you will love it!UninspiringYes, this class is tough but you will learn a lot if you put in the effort. I enjoyed the material and Neema&#39;s enthusiasm and knowledge of the topics.  I probably wouldn&#39;t recommend it as an elective because of the workload though.Though this class might have a pretty heavy workload, it definitely pays off in the end. Neema isn&#39;t about babying students through the course--you&#39;re really on your own to interpret what is said in lecture and apply it to the essays and the midterm. Overall, I highly recommend the course to anyone who has the time and energy that it requires.Only take this class if you have to\/if it&#39;s relevant to what you&#39;re studying. It is way too much work--both in terms of reading and essays if you&#39;re just looking for an elective.

Lecture tends to make you understand the material less than if you had never seen it before.Enthusiastic.  So what if hes a bit nerdy?? that makes him charming.  Overall good professor... really cares about his students.The entire class is dumbed down. His file drawer\/manilla folder analogy is useless (will never apply if you decide to go further in programming). Experienced programmers and intro programmers are confused.

He&#39;s obsessed with drawing boxes and folders to confuse you instead of teaching you how to program, and he loves testing on them.  Uses stupid metaphors to explain things.  Oh, he also uses a Mac and doesnt wear shoesProf Fan was very helpful and her class was always clear and organized.Not terrible, but I already understood the subject matter when taking the course.

I&#39;m not sure the lectures were terribly useful (are they ever?), but I kept going to class anyway because this guy is geeky and hilarious, and his love of what he does is infectious.

Grading was sometimes okay, sometimes unfair.  She tried to be understanding for the most part.Her class was disgustingly hard and confusing.  The prelims were killer.  I thought I had an interest in CS before taking this course, but I will never take one again.  They assume too much background knowlege and even when I understood a programming concept, the algorithims were way too hard.A really nice guy.

He teaches an extended metaphor of &#34;manilla folders&#34; as instances of classes, and we are tested in these horrible anolgies. However, Gries will give you the answers during prelims iFrom my experience, Gries is a great cs professor for those who are just starting to learn java. Granted you must put the effort into learning the material! If you don&#39;t, you can expect to do poorly, which is ultimately the studens&#39; fault not Gries&#39;s.Spent half of each lecture updating his typo-ridden powerpoint presentations. Add to that inconsistent grading, a $55 draft of a book, and the assumption that you already have programming experience, and you have a pretty horrible class.What an incredibly bad teacher.  The man has no idea how to present ideas for an audience, his folders\/files analogy is the worst I&#39;ve seen (and the TAs all think it&#39;s useless too) and his lectures show a total lack of respect for his students.  Someone sHorrible horrible class.  Stupid analogy system and you are tested more on that than on programming!  His lectures are unclear and he spent most of the time fixing his own mistakes.I enjoy her lectures.  Many ppl complain that her accent is stupid, or that the class is either too easy or hard, but quite frankly in cs class for ppl from basic engineers to cs majors, many are going to find it too hard while many find it to easy.At least the chairs were comfortable.Her classes are boring. Her accent is rather annoying and her projects are unnecessarily difficult.Bailey is entertaining.  However, his class is extremely difficult to the point where people are amazed at the material we&#39;re learning in an intro programming class.  He is also unaccomodating to students being that his office hours are at eight and he&#39;s rarely available at other times.Okay class with some nice assignments. The tests weren&#39;t very difficult either. The downside is that his lectures are really, really boring. By the second half of the class I just stopped attending.Bailey is the best. His british accent, vernacular and personality all make him a very entertaining professor. He will definitely work you, expect that. But, at the same time,he&#39;s assessible and , in the end, will not determine your grade on numbers aloneThe course is more about teaching you Gries&#39; metaphors and methods (which usually involve drawing boxes) than teaching you the concepts behind his metaphors and methods. James Gosling (the dude who started java) would probably fail the prelims because they&#39;re all about Gries&#39; boxes and not about java.Her lectures are extremely repetitive, if you don&#39;t understand her the first time try again the next five times. Quizzes in lecture to try and make you go, asks noncoding questions on tests to check if you read. Comfy chairs.she&#39;s totally awsome!!! take her class! go to her office hour!!!Good professor, is overly paticular about knowing his analogiesHe cares about every individual in his class and tries his best to help them as much as possible, not only within the course but also in terms of future plans and decisions. An excellent person and prof. Assignments are hard, but he&#39;s flexible for your needs. As long as you do the work, he gives good grades -better than what you&#39;d expect!Bailey is one of the best lecturers at Cornell. His class nearly killed me, but I learned a lot. I never fell asleep at his lectures, because he always knows how to make material interesting and entertaining.Gries is awful at teaching CS so if you don&#39;t have a background in Java make sure you buy a different textbook as Gries over complicates things and makes ridiculous analogies. Part of the problem is Gries wrote the textbook so many explanations are word for word from the book. Luckily prelims are easy but Gries spoils intro to Java.While Java is interesting, Gries is not a great writer or lecturer.  He has a very stilted way of speaking, and he over uses italics to make his writing just a stilted.  His analogies are extremely basic, to an infuriating degree - you could be a very accomplished Java programmer and fail his exams if you didn&#39;t understand his boxes. Silly!Sorry to disagree, but I think Gries was an awesome prof.  Very approachable.  The class was pretty easy, as long as you did the readings and attended lecture.  The concepts that he emphasized in the course were really useful for CS211.he makes you confused about the simplest of things. he has these stupid analogies about CS programming, and to him its more important that you learn his stupid analogies and methods rather than the ability to code. worst. professor. ever. (for me)This man is best teacher! He is so kind and makes lots of jokes. He knows his class is not totally easy, but if you but a little effort in, you will like this class very much becuase gries rocks! He was also voted best teacher many times at cornell...I really wanted to learn programming...but he made it very boring.  The lectures were a waste..too morbid. People were scared to raise hands!  I go to lectures for the profs, learning material on your own is no good when you can&#39;t get insight from good people.  The beginning of his course is good, easy to follow.  Later it&#39;s all over the place.He has a childish and annoying way of teaching programming. Besides that the material is easy if you work on it and memorize terms and boxes, etc. He has a very nasty attitude too. I asked him for help and he accused me of wasting his time! Very Upsetting but whatever - he&#39;s still easy.He has this very formulaic way of teaching programming. This might not be too bad if you don&#39;t have any programming experience. If you go to his lectures, read the textbook, and do assignments, you&#39;ll do well. Exams are not hard, you just have to know it the way he teaches you to.Difficult to attend class due to teacher.  Class seems pointless, programming is long and painful, it seems you have to program the way he would or you lose points (not much room to do you own programming), folders\/file-drawers. Take only if you have to.Nice guy but horrible teacherHe taught me computer prgramming (I had no previous ability).  I am fairly amazed at how much we covered, and, although at times it was fast paced, I have to say that if you put in the effort, it is worth it.  The homework is very difficult, but TA&#39;s (D.M esp) are helpful, and definitely group up.Avoid if possible.  Heavy emphasis on analogies involving file drawers, folders, and other office supplies.  Excessive focus on invariants when writing loops.  The textbook (his own) is riddled with typos, as are his assignments from time to time.I have a problem with folders and file cabinets.  And why do they have to be specifically manila folders?Tough but fair, if you put the work into his class you&#39;ll learn a lot.No CommentsThe hardest class I have taken at Cornell.

Lectures are very simple, projects are very hard and time consuming, but tests are fair and with a solid understanding of the material doable. Actually programming sucks, but once you figure it out it does make you feel pretty smart.I thought she was really clear in lectures, but sometimes a little on the boring side. Tests are quite fair, and even with everything everyone here has said about her, just remember- M is still a lot easier than J- just ask anyone who has taken J! Pay attention to the grading on your tests, because there is usually room to argue for points.Not a bad professor. Tests are fair and the projects are annoying but helpful. Make sure to get a good partner for the projects.Don&#39;t allow an initial impression to hide her unwillingness to address students&#39; difficulties.Final was fair but prelims were really really hard (fall semester &#39;07).

He spastic teaching methods are completely and utterly unhelpful.lecturing- not very effective. Labs- better. one on one- best.  the essential problem being that she cant be a privat tutor to everyone.  her lecture notes are far less complicated than what is assigned in projects.  she should be more explicit in lecture and not just grace over the subjects.his random grading policy screwed me over in the end...No CommentsThe material can be challenging if you&#39;ve never seen it before, but if you have even the slightest bit of experience with java or another language you&#39;ve got it made.  She is incredibly explicit, but the material can be tough and time consuming. Be prepared to spend mucho time on projects, and GET A PARTNER FOR THEM. it makes life so much easier! I learned a little java over the summer before i took her class and it paved the way to an A for me :)Unarguably the geekiest man alive, yet his silly laugh and his terribly corny jokes always put me in a good mood.  He does an excellent job of keeping the people with no programming experience on the same page as those with experience.Professor Fan&#39;s lectures were hard to follow. I recommend not missing any of them; she really jams a lot of information in that time. Although this is an introductory course, Fan moves through the material quickly.Crazy woman. Her exams and projects are insanely hard and they just keep getting hard every time she teaches the course. She seems out of touch with reality because she still seems to think that her exams and projects are not hard enough. She can also be pretty mean to students in lecture.He posts really detailed notes online which helped more than lecture itself, so I stopped going to lecture. I understood what was going on, and he was really wacky, lots of corny jokes. Kept me awake at 9:05. Warning: assignments can be long &amp;complicated.lectures hard to follow. she goes VERY fast. tests were reasonable, but it helps to review sample questions.I had no issue with Fan.  She was very nice. She does have an accent, it doesn&#39;t make her hard to understand. I had no programming experience prior, so the class was incredibly hard.  Take my advice, if you&#39;ve no prior experience, take it over the summer.Chew taught the MATLAB portion of this course, and I enjoyed his lectures. The course is very challenging if you&#39;ve had no prior programming experience.of course, if you&#39;ve had no programming experience whatsoever this class is very hard. but she goes out of her way to help you understand...all you have to do is go to her office hours.Tries to dumb down course even further, some times not clear, but overall very nice.Pretty good lecturer. All notes online so you don&#39;t have to go, but there are some iClicker quizzes. Projects are not too difficult and teach you the material, which means less studying for prelims, which are all extremely easy.awesome prof. explains things very well. go to her office hours if you miss lecture. unfortunately, she doesn&#39;t curve.The biggest nerd ever, but funny, and very good at what he does.  However, the course staff is terrible, the TAs are ok, but the counsultents (the people who grade stuff) are the worst, they are so arbitrey in grading, so beware for **** consultents.No CommentsI really like her.  She is very clear in lecture and the tests are fair.  The projects though are impossible and horrible.meh! I think that explains it all.No CommentsApparently this was tough for people who had not had background in computer science, but she will help you if you ask for help.  If you&#39;ve had any background programming whatsoever, her lectures refresh your memories well.  Projects can be time-consuming but are always manageable.not very clearThis is a very tough intro. course.  She&#39;s nice but she could be clearer in her teaching.The material can be hard, but she is helpful and patient.  Office hours and sections are beneficial.She started out allright, but as the course progressed, her lectures became increasingly frenetic. If I hadn&#39;t taken APCS in high school, I don&#39;t think I would have done as well. She can be impatient when you ask her questions, but overall she&#39;s a fairly pleasant person.Just didn&#39;t like her.Good lectures, esp. for java.  Learning MATLAB for 7 wks. however was the most impractical waste of time ever.  Hard class for ppl w\/ no programming experienceHasty and impersonal at office hours, and doesn&#39;t use a curve.  Makes an intro level course unnecessarily hard, especially since Matlab is not at all mainstream computer programming according to professionals.Professor Fan is very well organized. She also gives out notes in lecture, thus letting students listen more. Her explanations are always clear. The course gives a great foundation in both MATLAB and Java. Go to AEW&#39;s - they help a lot too!Super eazy class if you know what you are doing, really hard if you have no computer science experience at all (which most people don&#39;t).  Lectures are pretty boring too.The course requires Fan to teach to everybody from beginners to experienced programmers while using a lecture format, so it&#39;s no surprise she&#39;s not very good at it. Reading, sections, and projects are really the only way to learn in this class.Lec...   It is better to read the book by urself.  If u hadn&#39;t read the chapters before lec, u would not have understand what she said.  She makes this intro class like a review course for experienced programmers.  And some projects are useless.Useless class.  At least it scared me from the CS major.  She is a little bubbly, but the lectures were still boring (at least one of my group of friends fell asleep ... most often me).  One interesting part was her explanation of Objects.  Cookie cutter!No CommentsSchwartzie was an AWESOME professor. He makes sure everyone gets the subject matter, and that makes him a good man in my book. He&#39;s funny and nerdy and great! He recognizes that learning to program is learning a new convoluted language where everything is an order instead of a statement.just awful...I hate programming, but Fan was very entertaining as a Prof. I liked her a lot, I never went to office hours, but she seemed very approachable. The CS material was dry, but I really did like Prof. Fan.  Exams were easy for some, hard for others, it really just depended on how well you could program-lecture doesn&#39;t really influence that.","difficulty":3.24,"rating":3.04},{"index":1628,"prof_name":"Ramin Zabih","prof_dept":"Computer Science","class_name":"CS100R","comment":"Incredible class.

He is very rude, condescending and has no right to call himself a professor by the way he behaves. The book (which he wrote) is even worse than he is. Avoid this class!The only good thing to come of this class is that Gries gets to force even more undergrads to buy his book. Your assignments are graded by a computer, and you receive no help with regrade attempts. Consultants are not motivated to help you.

CS 1110 is very well-structured and the lectures are on-point. After the class I felt that I had a great foundation in CS and was confident in my abilities going into CS 2110. If you have the choice of taking CS 1110 in the fall with Walker White, I highly recommend it!!Class was taught differently than in the past. Very math based and not the best segway into other object-oriented languages. Good if you&#39;re in CS and going into data science-y classes.Professor White is a very fair grader, sometimes lenient, and he responds to your online questions quickly. There are regular labs and assignments, some of which are very long (10-15 hours to complete). White has a very extensive group of TAs and helpers, so finding help is very easy to do.A talented lecturer. Slides posted online and there is a large network of consultants available online and in-person. Class was well-designed and I learned a lot. This is the sort of class everyone with even a passing interest in CS should consider taking.Grading is very fair. He does really try to help you and wants you to get the best grade. If you come in with experience don&#39;t get cocky, met a few kids with a good amount of CS experience who didn&#39;t study and got B&#39;s on the first exam.An amazing professor. CS 1110 was an introductory course, but assignments can be fairly rigorous for those with lesser CS backgrounds. He is a fair grader--lenient, really--and help can always be found when you need it. Taking his class almost convinced me to switch to a CS major.  He is very fair and his lectures keep interesting. I&#39;d recommend.Great class, great lecturer, great experience.Professor Van Loan is a talented professor, but the course has so much material, that he doesn&#39;t always get a chance to fully elaborate on each concept. He&#39;s a great guy, but the course demands a lot, and the assignments are graded fairly hardly. Also, the prelims aren&#39;t too bad as long as you study, but the final was noticeably harder.He&#39;s seriously the best. He is extremely fair and helpful, as well as a clear lecturer. If you come from any CS experience, the class will probably be quite easy and no readings will be necessary as his lectures are detailed and clear by themselves.When I went in I hated computer science, but this guy was just awesome. My favorite lecturer at Cornell: really clear and does his best to make sure everyone understands what he&#39;s teaching. Would recommend any class with himVery knowledgeable of subject matter. Sometimes is repetitive during lectures, but he just wants to be clear. The slides are posted online for viewing whenever you want. iClicker questions sometimes during class, but your answers only matter for swaying borderline grades. Makes groanworthy jokesStrict and stern.  But otherwise, informative. Sometimes the responses he gives are really terse. But he will answer everything.  Also, genuinely helps students get better.Professor White is a good lecturer. He&#39;s really straightforward and makes the material very easy to understand.  As far as grades go, as long as you pay attention in class and study a bit for the exams, you should be able to get an A.Fun lectures, teaches wellLee is an incredible professor! She didn&#39;t lecture for 1110 (Bracy did) but she crafted all the labs and assignments. The labs were immensely helpful in learning new material and the assignments--though rather difficult--prepared you greatly for exams. She&#39;s always willing to help: talking after class, responding on Piazza, or meeting individually.Her and prof Merschner do all they can to help. I took this class with zero computer science background and ended up dropping it. It was with out a doubt the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever had do at Cornell. Asking questions I always felt like the dumbest person in the room. I&#39;m sure the professor was nice, but the subject she taught was way over my head I guess.Lillian Lee is the****. She knows a lot and is very passionate about what she is teaching. She&#39;s super silly, but a mad genius sort of way.He&#39;s a great professor, but if you are new to programming, the class is a lot of work. You will need all the help you can get, but as long as you ask, help will be provided by the truckload.Best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell though the class isn&#39;t that easyProf. White really goes out of his way to make sure that his students understand everything he says. Lectures, labs, and assignments are well-designed. Office hours, consulting hours, and Piazza are really helpful. Also, not many professors would print out handouts and lab instructions for all students, esp. when the school tries to restrict that.REALLLLLLLLY good with notes and resources Great Prof!Took CS 1110 Sp15. Really enjoyed the class and thought he did a good job of going over and introducing fundamental concepts.  He makes the assignments fun and thought that the workload was manageable(given that is a CS 4 credit class) Would definitely recommend taking it if he is teaching.Best Professor I&#39;ve ever had in any subject.  Lectures are extremely clear and well-made, and he explains complex computer science concepts in ways that a human can easily understand.  I&#39;d recommend taking his CS course just to have him as a teacher.This course has changed my mind about computer science. Before this course I was entertaining the possibility of a CS major or at the very least, a minor. However, after taking this course, I am completely assured that I will never take another CS course at Cornell or any other institution. Instead of being fun, this course was extremely tedious. Prof. White was an excellent professor. His After taking his class, I am leaning towards majoring or at least minoring in CS. I loved his mentality about learning CS as opposed to learning a language. Would HIGHLY recommend taking 1110 with Prof. White in the fall as opposed to the professor in the spring. Prof White is a great teacher and will help any student that asks. Granted, the assignments\/tests are tough--especially if you haven&#39;t programmed before. Lectures are good, but not mandatory; if you study you&#39;ll definitely get a B\/B+, which is good enough to move forward to CS 2110.Not very clear during lectures but always available for help.Pretty easy class although I did have a lot of prior experience with Python.hes absolutely awesome. explains things perfectly. makes total sense. would take again 100000\/10Absolutely excellent teacher! Loved by almost all students, never heard anyone who does not like him. His class is always soooo popular! Not too difficult for a computer science introduction class either. This is a class that can make you switch to computer science major after taking it. Would recommend to everyone I know.Walker White is an amazing professor. Even as someone who never took a CS course, he made sure everything was comprehensible. He&#39;s widely regarded as the man who changes people to CS for a reason.The best intro. cs professor!!! Made me switch my major to cs.Super knowledgeable, totally enjoyed this class, Some clicker questions, lectures posted online afterwards, projects pretty fun to do, consultants are also so helpful and one time stayed until 1 am helping people- you will be taken care of if you try in this classPretty chill, no surprises in the classWalker White is one of the best professors at Cornell. He is highly dedicated to each students&#39;s success. He also takes into account upward trends when assigning final grades, which is awesome considering a lot of people have little coding experience going into the class. I could not recommend more.Take this class in a semester when you aren&#39;t taking too many other classes. As a non-CS major, I found the concepts difficult to understand at first, but there are many helpful TAs and consultants. Start assignments early! Don&#39;t rely on consulting hours too much in the latter part of the semester... wait time can consume your entire evenings.probably the best lecturer i&#39;ve ever had in a computer science class, though that&#39;s not saying too much. the tests are quite difficult, but not unfairly so.It is really a excellent course. Helpful for all students.Great class, really interesting projects (had to build part of a computer game for the final :D). Assignments and prelims aren&#39;t too hard as long as you get started on time. Overall, a cool introduction to cs (for a complete programming noob). Additionally, accessible outside of class through office hours as well!Super smart guy who&#39;s nice but definitely has no sympathy if you&#39;re taking the intro course and realize you aren&#39;t too good at it. Very ok with the fact that the bottom 20% of the class will get a C and doesn&#39;t reveal your grade until the end so you can estimate but it will go up or down a few points based on curving.AMAZING teacher!! Made CS concepts really easy to understand. Lecture attendance wasn&#39;t mandatory, but they were really helpful for practicing\/applying concepts discussed in lesson videos. Not a lot of HW and plenty of time given for projects.The way Prof. White adjusted his teaching to the COVID reality is outstanding. His videos are always informative and engaging!Get ready to work! Labs, assignments, prelims and a final. U will be exposed to a lot of CS concepts thru the vehicle of Python and his lectures will not be enough to cement the concepts. U should utilize supplemental resources like stack overflow, Youtube, Lynda, python tutor, etc. Pro Advice: Live in office\/consulting hoursHe seemed apathetic towards students who had a hard time learning the material. His lectures are not that well. He creates like 90 slide power points. Definitely doesn&#39;t give as much support to new leaners as a lot of the other professor in the CS department. Prelims are fine. Final is typically a bit harder.Intro python over the summer was hard with him. I wouldn&#39;t say impossible, but expect to earn your grade. homework was hard(our last one was a graphical transportation simulation ). The final was doable, but you really got to understand how to explain the material (open-ended). He explains well enough, though, even when it&#39;s tough for intro cs .Comically nerdy guy, but nice enough. As someone who knew nothing about CS I learned a lot. Lectures are recorded so there&#39;s no reason to attend. Everything&#39;s curved heavily. Median was a B, I think.TAs were always there to help at night. Professor Bailey was a bit to complicated for the Introductory course I took. He gave one long and (usually) difficult homework assignment every week or week and a half. He&#39;s pretty funny and a good guy to talk to, but be prepared to work hard if you want a good grade in his class.Prof. Bailey is extremely knowledgeable, not only in his command of the material, but also in how he understands and relates to students. He&#39;s very kind and caring. He&#39;s a very interesting person who makes everything come to life with his enthusiasm for the material, which is really obvious when he explains things. I highly recommend him as a prof.I love Bracy! She&#39;s a great professor and her lectures are done in a way that is easy to understand and accessible. Assignments are always geared towards what we have already learned; if you can do the assignments, the tests should not be too difficult. There are clicker questions to log attendance, but they&#39;re only 5% of your grade.Bracy is so great that I&#39;m taking CS 2110 with her next semester. I loved her teaching style because I am a very visual learner (she&#39;s won teaching awards). She inspires great questions from her students in lecture, and the lecture material clearly laid out what was expected on exams. Beware of the tricky assignments and make use of office hours.Her lectures were usually pretty good, but sometimes slightly disorganized. She&#39;s super nice though and has plenty of office hours! Apparently her assignments were a lot harder than the fall CS 1110 professor&#39;s, but they were doable.Bracy is by far the best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell! She is passionate about CS and her lectures are clear and enormously helpful. The assignments were quite difficult at times but prepared you greatly for the prelims and final. I came in with zero coding experience and learned so much in a semester. Challenging but immensely rewarding class!She is a great professor. Her lecture style was clear, and I the examples made tough concepts easy to learn. Her expectations were clear and it was easy to gage how I was doing in the class. Not an overbearing amount of work, and makes CS really fun to learn. Also, she is just an awesome human.He goes out of his ways to help students. I personally found this class hard, probably because it&#39;s my first time studying CS, but it&#39;s definitely worthwhile.He explains things well and I love how he mocks Yale&#39;s CS major ppl LOL.Walker is a gem. Amazing lecturer, gives interesting and helpful projects\/weekly homework. Really cares about how you do in the class, and is always ready to help in person or via piazza (piazza is also a gem &lt;3 ).Also, grades super fairly. Your grade is based on knowledge of the material, and not (completely) on how others did in comparison to youLabs and assignments helped me teach the material, except the last assignment took me forever to finish (had no programming experience before coming to the class). Tests can be hard, but they are reasonable. There are many consultants available for help, but the hours can be very crowded around the time when the assignments are due.Walker is a really amazing professor. His lectures are great. You can learn a lot from him. The assignments require some effort but they are interesting to do.Walker is an AMAZING professor. I came in with no programming skill and I can honestly say I am pretty proficient right now and definitely ready for harder courses. The assignments and labs are HARD and the prelims require a lot of preparation. But if you are willing to put in the work, he is very fair. He just wants you to learn!Good lectures, doesnt curve, fair grader.I came in to this class with a fair amount of CS Experience.   Walker definitely makes you work for your grade.  I didn&#39;t do as well as I should have because I got a bit cocky.  Go to lectures, because it will make so much sense.  Also do projects and labs, and make sure you understand them.  Tests are doable if you spend time studying.You don&#39;t need the textbook (ever), going to lab sessions is optional, and tests are not particularly hard. Pretty good lecturer and explains things clearly, but none of the material is hard anyways. The class is even easier because sometimes 80% is an A, even though it&#39;s not relative to the class. Easy course but you will learn a good amount.The professor himself is an amazing professor and I&#39;ve learned alot in the first few weeks. However, if you never programmed before, you can get behind very easily and it&#39;s extremely hard to catch back up. The labs do not help and I think a recitation would be a better use of time.If you attend lectures, do all the assignments, and ask for help, you&#39;ll be fine.Professor Walker is a great teacher. He teaches you all the basics and advanced stuff in programming. The class starts out easy, then it gets harder at the end.kindHe is a really fantastic lecturer and has very clear schedule. His materials are close to his lecture and provides you enough practice for the coding and exam. Tests are reasonable and assignments are interesting. Though I&#39;ve got 5 in AP CS, I never regret taking this intro class, since the material is so much more advanced than AP.Walker&#39;s a great prof! The assignments require a lot of work, but are extremely interesting. It&#39;s hard to go to class and not listen to him - the lectures are interesting.Walker White is a legend. Honestly, I don&#39;t think I would be a CS major if I didn&#39;t have White, Walker. He is such a great lecturer and all his assignments and labs really make sure that you leave having a great understanding of computer science.He was pretty good. It&#39;s just that the class itself though was a crap ton of work. I know I could have done better if I had a partner for the assignments. The median grade is a B so just try to get above the median if you&#39;re curious as to how you&#39;re faring.He&#39;s so great at explaining stuff. Go to lecture and pay attention, start assignments early, use piazza, and you&#39;ll be fine.Amazing Professor! Really made me love Computer Science and I came as an absolute novice with no programming experience. Lots of work outside of class and the latter assignments do tend to get tricky but exams and prelims are generally fair apart from one tricky question.His lectures are amazing and he is very helpful during office hours.Walker is a great teacher.. for those who have a CS background. I took CS1110 in the fall and Walker adjusted his teaching style to a faster paced one since many people in my class had CS background. Projects became progressively harder and although there were many resources so many people needed help, those resources were barely useful.Good teacher. Very Difficult course.Amazing professor. &#39;nuff saidProfessor White is so funny and clear. I look forward to his lectures every Tuesday and Thursday because I&#39;m always learning with the occasional laugh. The class itself is a lot of work, especially with no CS experience, as it seems like half the class is always a month ahead which is a bit frustrating. But, don&#39;t let it dissuade you. Highly rec&#39;d.Even though this class was very tough, his passion for CS and the material he teaches is infectious. Great teacher; if you can take CS 1110 with him.Highly recommended. He knows so much about the content and very passionate in teaching students. I have never done CS before and came in I honestly hated CS coming in, but his class is so good that I am currently considering majoring in. Anytime you bring up Harvard CS, he can roast them for an hour straight and its the funniest thing ever.Walker White is a fantastic teacher. He is dedicated to the success of his students and is always willing to give advice. All material in the course is extremely useful and all work is assigned to prepare students for future CS classes and the exams. His lectures are clear and very informative, well developed and easy to follow. All around great.Course is not too hard if you put in the work; for me, assignments and labs made up for exam scores. Highly recommend attending consulting hours, etc. Prof. White is concise and effective at communicating material, and somewhat humorous, but a bit cold\/impersonal (since he has so many students) otherwise.Lecture attendance (iClicker use) is worth 1% of the grade. Prelims are 15% each, final is 30%, assignments are 38%. The class material is extremely easy, but the exams and assignments are graded very particularly. Get a good partner. Amazing lecturer.Prof. White is a fantastic lecturer. Very clear, concise, engaging, organized, and entertaining. Even when the material gets tough, he is always enthusiastic. I would highly recommend him. Likely the best lecturer I&#39;ve had at Cornell so far.I felt like learning during his lectures. Professor Walker is a great teacher ! Course starts very easy but gets harder later. I found assignments fun to do. I did not like the tests that much because his tests are hard.I loved professor White. Great lecturer, great since all lectures are online, lectures are very organized, assignments are well explained and while grading can be a little rough for exams it&#39;s fair. Helpful in office hours and on piazza when I needed it as well. Highly recommend taking Python, or any class, with professor WhiteHe is never going to teach again at Cornell!!! :(( He is the reason I am going into computer science. Best professor ever. Prelims were really challenging and final was easy. Assignments are not bad if you have done all your reading. Labs are really useful!Super energetic and passionate! Class was structured well. Projects can be difficult but there are many resources at your disposal.Super inspirational professor who clearly loves CS! Although the assignments took a long time, they were completely based on material learned in lecture (as are the exams.) She was great about using a wide variety of creative examples to explain thing.I really enjoyed class with Prof Bailey. I loved lecture, and enjoyed the somewhat open ended problems, since he graded them fairly according to how open ended they were. I loved the final project, and found him helpful when I chose to wait to talk to him instead of a TA. Was reasonably understanding about asking for extension.Literally the best prof I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Very clear and logical lectures.Really loved her lectures. Clear and logical.He is very good!He teaches the class at a really fast pace.Prof. White is extremely clear, engaging, and I enjoyed having him as my professor thoroughly. He&#39;s very friendly and approachable, and I wish more professors lectured like him.Most entertaining professor I have had at Cornell.  Definitely made me more interested in the subject matter.  Very clear lecturer goes back and forth between lecture slides and actual examples in the program.Professor White was a great teacher, and he took me from no interest in computer science to a computer science major.He is without a doubt the most helpful professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell. He will explain anything and everything during office hours &amp; had 30 minute time blocks you could sign up for if you were really struggling. I would walk in with zero clue about how to finish an assignment and walk out being able to do it on my own. Awesome, awesome guy!A great class structure, and a somewhat above average teacher. With the labs and assignments, you get a ton of practice with coding and quickly learn a LOT. He is friendly and piazza, the online cs question page, is very useful.Mr. White was pretty good. His lectures were decent and he thoroughly covered the material. Pretty touch grader though--he nit picks assignments and exams, for sure. but for someone who is a prospective CS major, he does a good job at a providing a thorough introduction.Walker White is a great professor. Although sometimes he might come across as arrogant, he is very passionate about computer science, and very accomodating; He is always willing to take time out of his schedule to meet with students, and cares to see that you actually learn the material. The projects were interesting, but quite challenging.Such an amazing professor. I came in with no programming experience but he made the class really fair and it wasn&#39;t anything too difficult. Assignments take a lot of time but he provides a lot of help for those who need it. Class is graded fairly and he actually wants everyone to do well.Very good prof, but hard class for non CS or ENG majors. I took it on a whim (for some strange reason). He really does want his students to do well.I loved his lectures and he is very helpful and willing to explain things if you do not understand them. Overall the class is not too hard and fun and definitely worth taking.Great Professor. He is a really good lecturer and is always there if you need help.Pretty funny at times and definitely passionate about the subject.  Class can be irritating for those who have prior experience.  Gries is very set in his ways and obsessed with his metaphors and invariants.White is amazing. He knows his CS, will answer every question, is very passionate about CS, and is incredibly organized. Also two of the major assignments are really fun and they&#39;ll keep you interested. He has an army of like 30 consultants who always seem to hanging around in the lab to help. Also, take it if you are undecided about your major.I didn&#39;t really learn much in lecture (hard to learn programming by staring at a powerpoint). Labs and assignments helped a lot more for understanding. Prelims and final are somewhat challenging, but gives us previous exams to study. I never programmed before and I thought the class was alright.  He&#39;s retiring so not teaching CS 1110 anymore.Literally treats you like a 1st grader. Doesn&#39;t care at all about actually writing functional code. Beginning of the class is more about drawing pictures than actually learning to program. Makes stuff unnecessarily confusing. I usually skip lectures. Assignments graded way to harshly and for the wrong reasons. Worst professor I&#39;ve had at CU so far.Terrible experience.Love this prof! Class is hard, but Bailey makes it worth going - so glad I had the chance to learn from him! :)Professor Baileys teaching has subpar performance in class as a lecturer, and he is unhelpful during office hours. He is unable to convey the material clearly, and unfortunately he does not teach well.He teaches fast and his homework is tough but you will learn how to program and you will be glad to have had him. He taught me more about math then any math teacher I ever had before him. He&#39;s always available after class and he even helped me with an essay unrelated to the class.Very helpful when asked questions, promptly responds to emails, exams closely follow previous years, cares about studentsConfusing concepts with the folder stuff doesn&#39;t make sense. Assignments and labs are EXTREMELY difficult if you&#39;ve never programmed. Have to constantly get help from TAs, Consultants, friends. Takes too much time.I dont even know where to begin with this man. The assignments are graded abnormally harshly, he doesn&#39;t explain anything, the book that he wrote and makes us use is an illegible joke. He is more obssessed with drawing folders than programming. Avoid this man at all costs, you will not do well in his class.I had no programming experience before this. Gries is not that clear until about the 5th time he repeats a subject. YOU have to put in serious work to do well, it&#39;s not a freebie class. With that said, I think the grading is hard but fair. He is actually extremely helpful if you ask. Prof Lee was teaching this class with him, that helped a LOTGries is pretty boring, and I could only pay attention to Lillian Lee&#39;s lectures. He can be pretty helpful though and is a nice grandpa-like guy. For a first-timer at compsci, the textbook and beginning of labs were very confusing for me. The best help is to see the consultants, not the busy TAs. Once you&#39;ve got the basics, the rest is fine.Terrible!  He seemed like a very nice man, but I had no programming experience, and after this class, I still don&#39;t have any.  This is absolutely the reason I switched out of Engineering.Lectures were boring and important material on prelims were never covered in lecture. I was lost in labs because he never taught anything relevant in class and expected us to be able to figure it out ourselves in lab. He is also overly picky on the style code. TA&#39;s were helpful though.Horrible professor - nice guy. Doesn&#39;t understand the purpose of a metaphor.I absolutely loved CS before this class. In this class I absolutely understood nothing that he said. The only stuff I knew was what my high school teacher had taught me (he was much better). Gries really was extremely nice but I learned nothing at all. It made me hate CS... :(I don&#39;t know what everyone is talking about - I really liked Prof. Gries. He is a very nice guys and I found him to be a very effective lecturer. I had no experience whatsoever in CS and I felt that I understood class and he even piqued my interested in the field. Personally, I&#39;d highly recommend him. Best teacher I&#39;ve had at Cornell yet.Very knowledgeable on the subject (he literally wrote the book), but is an awful teacher.Never taken a CS class before. He was excellent introductory CS teacher - keep an open mind and good attitude in his class and his way of teaching works extremely well to help you grasp the material. I don&#39;t understand all this Gries-hating that goes on. CS is not meant to be an easy subject, his class is as easy an introduction as it gets.It&#39;s really hard. Go to classI took this over summer. Lectures were usuall rambling, especially having to do with calculus and other unrelated math concepts, and the few homeworks that we had were nearly impossible with what he taught in class. One assignment was so hard that he extended it 2 times, but only on the last day after we&#39;d all agonized over it and gotten no TA helpIf you want to be taught programming like a kindergartener, take this course. If you want to reprimanded every time you make a typo in your syntax, take this course. If you want your grade to suffer because your variable names aren&#39;t the ones Gries wanted, take this course. If your believe that your program working doesnt matter, TAKE THIS COURSE.I don&#39;t understand know why so many people don&#39;t like his teaching style; really, professor Gries is just trying to teach us the basic stuff of programming. For those jackasses who can&#39;t program at all and think they are smart, do not blame professor GriesWhite is an amazing teacher, very clear, organized and interesting. His grading is a little harsh but he&#39;s a great teacher nevertheless.Nice guy, but atrocious teacher. Supposedly the rest of the CS department is superb except him. I had no programming experience and did terribly in this class even after working hard on it. TAs didn&#39;t seem to care. Tests are graded harshly. Had to drop the class. It reflects poorly on Cornell to have him as an introductory prof.","difficulty":3.3787878788,"rating":4.1590909091},{"index":1635,"prof_name":"Daisy Fan","prof_dept":"Computer Science","class_name":"CS1112","comment":"Daisy Fan is a really good professor. Her lectures are organized, and she also posts them online. She&#39;s very friendly if you have any questions, and the course staff are also pretty helpful. The projects take hours to complete, so try to get a partner. Make sure you don&#39;t got to consulting the day before its due, because you won&#39;t get any help.You have to go to class because she does clicker questions. Also, the code discussed in class is very likely to show up on the prelims. Sometimes her pacing is a little wonky (both too fast and too slow), but the discussion sections help you get over that lapse. Overall, she&#39;s a pretty fun professor and I would take her again.I had a pretty strong knowledge of programming before this class so I didn&#39;t depend on lectures much. But she was very clear and enthusiastic during lectures and was very nice outside of class as well! I found that most people liked her during my semester but it was quite the opposite the next.Don&#39;t know why everyone below loves her but I was new to programming and made every attempt to learn by going to her office hours only to be rudely undermined and left to work on my own. She just makes assumptions about you and judges in a very condescending manner. Prelims seemed relatively reasonable, but they certainly weren&#39;t graded reasonably!One of the best professors I&#39;ve ever had in my entire life.  She really knows what she is talking about and very excited about teaching programming.  She&#39;s very clear in her lectures.Daisy Fan is by far the best teacher I had last semester. All of her lectures were helpful and posted online for reference. Help was easily found in her class.Daisy is the best! I didn&#39;t know anything about CS before I took her class and she made the material really easy to understand and was incredibly helpful during office hours. The projects took forever to complete but they were the only homework.Some people are just better at programming than others. Too bad I wasn&#39;t one of those people. I found her tough (never programmed before), but she taught me a lot.A great lecturer who really helps give comprehensive insight on the material. This was my first ever computer science course, and while the material was difficult at times, it was a rewarding experience to go through. She provides the textbook online for free and keeps lectures interactive with clicker questions as well.I really like her powerpoint slides. Printing them out and bringing them to the lectures next day make the class go easier. She&#39;s pretty clear but she only touches on the basics, even though the projects take forever to finish... The CMS website allows students to see each of their grades, which is nice too.Prof Fan was my favorite professor; she was so clear and helpful. Her office hours are great. Projects take forever, but are very helpful for learning the material. Exams are fairly easy. There&#39;s no curve, so do well on them!Excellent, very clear professor, one of the best I have ever had.Very clear, very helpful teacher. Awesome! Very accurate and understandable. The course packets tended to be way harder than the class, HW, or tests, and only reiterated what she said in class. She posted almost everything to the web, so it was easy to see what she covered when. I wish I had more classes like that one!I had a programming class before this one, but by comparison this one was clearer and very well-organized. Helpful sections and very clear lectures that kept my interest.The projects will be the best way to learn the material, and sometimes she speaks softly.I really appreciated Daisy&#39;s effort she put in to her lectures. It definitely felt like she knew what she was talking about and tried to convey the relevant stuff. She was also incredibly helpful in office hours, and I couldn&#39;t have done the projects without her help.I came into this class with no prior CS experience which made it very challenging. Considering that Daisy has to lecture to such as wide range of skill, she does a pretty good job. I learned a lot in this class, but definitely focus more on studying for exams considering they are worth nearly 3\/4 of your course grade.GOOD PROF. PROJECTS TAKE SO LONG.I had minimal cs experience going into this class but Daisy WILL teach you how to code by the time you come out. She is easily one of the kindest, most compassionate and caring professors who will do everything she can to help you succeed. The projects can be overwhelming and terrifying but if you do them the tests are VERY fair and manageable.Lectures were pretty good but get ready to spend hours on the projects. Projects are definitely do-able, just time-consuming. Be wary.Took this class Fall 2020. Majority of work comes as exercises, assigments, and prelims which won&#39;t be too hard as long as you get started on time. Additionally, Professor Fan makes many of the resources easily accessible outside of class and there are definitely opportunities to talk to her outside of class as well (highly recommend!)Intensive project assignments, but helpful lecture materials. All is well except homework is a lot.Really enthusiastic professor who is very clear and logical. Projects get exponentially more challenging but exams are pretty simple.I came into the class with no prior programming experience, but the material was very straightforward, Daisy did a great job of explaining the concepts. The projects took a long time but were otherwise fine, the tests were a little on the easy side.Lovely professor with an enthusiastic personality. The 6 projects are interesting and not substantially time consuming. She often rants endlessly about the same concept for half an hour without moving forward which often makes lectures boring. Loved the class, take it!Lectures are pretty easy to follow. Exams are very fair and straightforward. Projects can be time consuming but really help solidify some concepts. I really recommend taking the AEW offered. Her grading system is terrible, very few people get the highest grades.She is incredible!! She takes the time to meet individually with students and clearly really cares!! So wonderful!Great professor, very engaging and excited about the material. She really wants you to learn. Would take another class taught by her in a heartbeat. Definitely the best professor I&#39;ve had so far.To be honest, I dun understand why people find her good. As someone who has no prior knowledge of programming, I feel that she did a very poor job at explaining the material, and worse, try to complicate simple things. The commonplace application of math is obnoxious at best and to be honest, MatLab is not a programming language..She is very prepared and tries to be very clear. She reviews certains parts of lecture in depth until you completely understand the concept. Workload is easy (too easy, perhaps?) and grading fair.While she is one of more empathetic and caring professors on this campus, the course itself gave me a lot of anxiety. It never felt like a intro class to me because too many people who had coding experience and they were are the only ones getting high grades. The class was hard and deflated as 92 was a B+. If you value your grade take python.Clear lecturer and very open to helping students outside of class. The course is a very standard intro programming course, doesn&#39;t really teach specific features of MATLAB. I learned the most from projects, but lectures were also helpful. Additional resources like the recommended reading and discussions were slightly less important to me.Such a passionate and energetic woman. Absolutely love her. Her lectures are clear and organized, and she is very approachable outside of class.She&#39;s a nice lady. The projects can get lengthy towards the end. The tests weren&#39;t too hard, but they would take off for the most insignificant things. Make sure to look over their rating on prelims, they messed up on both of mine and I got some points back.Intro CS classes can be tough because some people know how to code, others don&#39;t. Some people can pick it up easily, others don&#39;t. While I found her lectures interesting, the assignments I found impossible because the lectures were not directly related to the assignments. I spent 20-25 hours every other week in office hours in order to complete hw.I took this class with absolutely no coding experience and it was extremely hard in the beginning. This class is an absurd mix of students with no experience and students who&#39;ve been coding for years. It takes some time and lots of practice (give urself time for the projects!!!!) but Daisy really will teach u how to code and succeed if u stick w itProfessor Fan did a great job describing all of the different concepts that we needed to know, and I enjoyed the format for assignments as well (a short &#34;exercise&#34; each week and a &#34;project&#34; with multiple parts every two weeks). Nothing I would&#39;ve changed to improve that class.Prof Fan&#39;s been teaching the course every semester for a number of years, and it shows. As someone who had never coded before this class, I was able to do very well by studying the lecture slides. The 6 projects take a long time, but they also helped me with the material a TON. There was no curve, so be sure to not make careless errors on exams.Great class.  She is an amazing teacher who takes the time to walk thoroughly through even the simplest of concepts (if you&#39;re paying attention.)  I came into the class with no CS background and now am considering CS as my major.  Be prepared to work your ass off when the projects come around!She is a great lecturer!  The projects were difficult and took insane amounts of time, but the exams were never as bad as the projectsGreat professor! Very enthusiastic, kept lectures interesting, able to answer all questions.No prior MATLAB experience. Professor is meh. Lectures are clear and she seems enthusiastic, but she&#39;s very repetitive and simplifies things so I dosed off for almost every lecture. Sometimes the simplification even makes things more difficult. The first exam was very easy, but the rest were relatively difficult. Projects are very time consuming.CS 1112 is a difficult class but Daisy is a great lecturerGreat lecturer. Very clear.Tests are fair. Projects are a lot of work. If you have background experience in programming this class will be easier, which explains the amount of people that gave this class a 1 in difficulty.Very helpful, if somewhat boring during lecture, professor. The class is very easy if you just do everything you&#39;re supposed to. I just felt that the lectures that took 50 minutes or more could have easily been finished in 10. It just got really boring, I ended up sleeping through the majority of the later lectures cause it got really repetitiveDaisy Fan has really basic lectures. Her book for cs1112 barely helps. Lecture recordings available online, which is good. Discussions are helpful. However, her projects are going to murder you. Expect zero hours of work some weeks and 20 hours when there are projects due. Don&#39;t take 112 if you can take 110. Easy if you have a cs background.Good class - clear, well-organized, and an easy A if you put in the time.Professor Fan is amazing. Her class is well organized and pretty clear and I would definitely recommend it. Assignments are time-consuming but tests are generally straightforward.I feel bad for Her. She has to teach an intro CS class so kids who have been coding since 2 yrs don&#39;t get 100s and kids who have never coded don&#39;t get 0s. Daisy obviously fails &amp; the poor kids who needed it most come out with a horrid grade and hatred for CS. Cornell needs to create a different class for the kids who already have a basis in codingLectures are clear and helpful but often more repetitive and thorough than necessary. Probably boring for anyone who already knows something about programming. Professor is nice and willing to answer questions. The reading is helpful but not entirely necessary. No homework besides projects.Lectures were often confusing and a bit dull. If you fall behind in this class it can be difficult to catch up. The grading policy is a bit unfair. There is no curve and grading on tests and assignments is sometimes very harsh. If you&#39;re already familiar with cs, this class won&#39;t be a problem.Very enthusiastic lecturer, and very clear.  Assignments are tough, but tests are very fair.","difficulty":3.2452830189,"rating":4.1509433962},{"index":1636,"prof_name":"Noah Snavely","prof_dept":"Computer Science","class_name":"CS1114","comment":"Awesome prof.

When he did attempt to actually inform you of something, it was generally done in a condescending tone using insipid metaphors.His projects and his course material didn&#39;t match. Left his TAs to grade (rather arbitrarily and poorly). Couldn&#39;t write an assignment that made sense if his life depended on it.the subject matter of this class should be interesting (and is, when you just do it on your own), but his lectures are completely useless. I would say he&#39;s one of the worst teachers I&#39;ve ever had. He seems like a nice man though.Different sense of humor, he&#39;s british, but very funny. I think i was the only person in the class that got some of his funniest jokes. Great teacher, explained difficult material very well. His projects were ridiculously hard though. Know material well.Professor Chew sucks. He skips by his lecture slides without explaining anything. He probably expects all his students to be CS majors who knows this stuff already - well not me! (I had CS100j with Gries, so I&#39;m probably below par...) The lecture notes themselves weren&#39;t that clear either, so self-study doesn&#39;t really help...avoid him!hyperactiveThis class is a lot of work, but Kozen is a pretty good teacher.  Most of your grade comes from the projects rather than tests (I failed a prelim and did pretty well in the end).  The projects are interesting which makes them easier to do, but you still must figure out a lot on your own.No CommentsKozen, unlike many professors, knows how to teach.  Presentation is clear and explains concepts very well.  Prelims are quite hard but most of your grade comes from the assignments, which are straightforward.  Friendly and understanding, likes to give extensions.Nice guy, tries to explain things. Projects are WAY too long!!!!!!Kozen is a good guy. He really cares about helping his students, from what I can tell. I&#39;ve been to his office hours a few times and he&#39;s really friendly, and he knows how to teach. The class is really easy too, as it&#39;s not graded on a curve. I got a good grade and I learned a lot. I highly recommend cs 211 with Kozen.Pretty bad lecturer, didn&#39;t seem to recognize the slides.  Might want to read them over before class!  Obviously smart, but ill prepared.No Commentsputs together tough assignments and test but willing to lend a helping hand if you need it.  Always a good idea to develop a rapport with him.Good Class.  Projects were well defined.bailey is infectiously enthusiastic and criminally insane. the law of excluded middle will be obvious; you&#39;ll either love or hate this guyThis was the worst class I ever took because Prof Schwartz is disorganized. He asumes everybody already knows the material, so he doesn&#39;t bother teaching it.  I respect what he knows, but he&#39;s still a computer nerd.This man is the devilCS 211 was not a well managed course, but Schwartz can&#39;t be entirely blamed.  It&#39;s tough to find a balance between boring the master hackers and dizzying those who have never seen Java before.  He got better at explaining ideas as the semester went on.Bailey is amazing. Brilliant man, brilliant lectures - he&#39;s a fantastic lecturer!! He challenges his classes but holds up the teaching end of the spectrum very well. If he&#39;s teaching a class, TAKE IT! You&#39;ll be glad you did.This was the worst class I&#39;ve taken here at Cornell. This guy is absolutely terrible.

I know a lot of students skip lectures, but I found his lectures to be very useful and representative of the knowledge needed for the prelims. If you do well on the first two prelims, Gries lets you skip the final and take your grade as it is.Gries is the most caring professor I have seen in Cornell. He makes lots of efforts to help students learn from this lecture. Some of assignments and prelims are challenging though, he and George respond to the questions on piazza efficiently. Go to his OH! It&#39;s super helpful, and you will find how patient he is going to teach you.Gries is incredibly caring and genuinely interested in helping his students. He can be quite sassy on Piazza, which can annoy some students, but I personally thought it was hilarious and gave him personality. Regardless, he is an engaging and humorous lecturer and is very willing to help you if you ask for it.He&#39;s a pretty nice guy, but only if you establish yourself early as someone who is there to learn and not simply sit in lecture bored all day. He can be arrogant at times, but his lectures are clear, at least. The TAs help out a lot. The assignments have nothing to do with what you&#39;re learning in lecture, so start early.Very interesting, though non-mandatory lectures. Clearly a legend in CS. Deeply cares about every student&#39;s success. Amazing teacher. Optional final. Watch out, though: mandatory midterms are very hard and he doesn&#39;t believe in curves (&#34;if you all do C work, you will all get Cs&#34;). TAs are very mediocre, and recitation attendance is very important.On the surface, Prof. Birman seems to be an excellent and engaging professor.  His lectures are fairly clear, and assignments are challenging but fair.  However, as the semester progresses, a different side of him begins to show.  He is highly condescending and egotistical.  If you&#39;re an undergraduate, HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOU.  That&#39;s it.His tests are hard but the lectures are extremely useful, very well organised and cover important topics. One of the best professors for Computer Science anywhere in America.Lectures were not helpful at all. You&#39;re basically on your own to learn the material and for the projects.The lectures were vague and not related to the material that we were tested on. The example code given in class or on quizzes was wrong on multiple occasions. And Birman&#39;s arrogant attitude did not help matters. While Birman was at one point a key player in his area, he has not stayed current in a changing fieldterrible professor, rapid unhelpful lectures, very arrogant and rude. projects hurt you but they cant help, only grades that matter are the two prelims and if u do poorly on one that&#39;s probably the grade u wil getpretty easy class, dont like the written testsGries is honestly hilarious. He&#39;s a slightly boring lecturer but is very fair and keeps the topic interesting. I liked the guy a lot.This class was very poorly designed.  The Exams, Lectures, and Codding assignments were three disparate entities.  There was a ton of support from TA&#39;s and lots of Office hours.  Birman had this incredibly pretentious attitude in his lecturing that evinces his arrogance.Gries is a solid professor. I learned an immense amount about OO-programming and data structures from the course. Prelims and the final project account for most of your grade in the course (particularly prelim 2). Very helpful in office hours. He is very knowledgable and has worked with some of the world&#39;s best computer scientists.Prof. Gries is an amazing professor! He explains the material well in lecture, and it&#39;s neat to see his personal touch on programming topics, including a surprising amount of history. Let him know if you are struggling: he is kind, willing to help, and cares about students as people. Go to lecture.Gries is a very experienced professor, with a strong reputation throughout Cornell CS. He provides many resources to succeed in his class: good powerpoints, practice tests, handouts, piazza answers, and TA lectures make this class very manageable with some effort. The prelims aren&#39;t too hard if you use the practice exams, and the final is optional.A rude, arrogant, disrespectful professor. Its time for someone else to take over this course.Assignments were less time-consuming compared to those of CS 1110, but still took me a lot of time. Lecture slides and the lecturers (Gries and Clarkson) were pretty solid, and office hours were less crowded than CS 1110&#39;s. However, Gries was pretty condescending toward students on Piazza.Very cool professor but even after teaching this class for a substantial portion of his life still organizes it horribly. Grading is a nightmare with large sums of points being given, taken, and returned without rhyme or reason. Important things seem to be decided on a whim. Held my breath getting back assignments I knew for a fact I did correctly.u should take this classSometimes confusing and can be rude when you try to ask questions on Piazza. He gets the information through, but lectures are not terribly interesting and he is very particular about certain things.Great professor and learned a lot from his lectures. Was also very accomodating when we transitioned online.He is so great!David Gries was one of the most understanding professors during the pandemic. I recommend all people take 2110. He and Clarkson make the class engaging and interesting. Grading is fair and not on a normal type of curve. Gries is a legend for a reason.Attendance isn&#39;t exactly mandatory but I found going to lecture helpful. Class was medium difficulty for me because while assignments are easy, I consistently perform below the mean on exams (final is now mandatory btw). Gries is easy to understand and extremely charming and funny in an old man way. Piazza will become the God you worship.The professor hardly explains anything and is extremely rude whenever you reach out. The class has no set system that is followed and grades are given out randomly.Lectures are kinda boring and once in awhile he gets lost in his own examples. Incredibly fast response time if you ask him questions online; his replies are usually brief and even a little cold but I think its unintentional. He writes obscure and not really topical questions on the tests but Foster has made the questions more reasonable recently.Extremely interesting professor.  I actually enjoyed going to lectures.  Assignments are hard and time consuming; however, i liked his style of &#34;do it yourself&#34; projects where you start from scratch rather than filling in pre-organized methods\/classes.Here is how the class is structured: 1) you will immediately be thrown into an extremely fast paced introduction of Java and be expected to pump out applications from scratch 2) you will learn important data structures that Bailey makes you implement in your homework 3) you will be rewarded if you work hard. Goodluck the work is worth it in the endAttendance isn&#39;t exactly mandatory but I found going to lecture helpful. Class was medium difficulty for me because while assignments are easy, I consistently perform below the mean on exams (final is now mandatory btw). Clarkson is extremely clear, easy to understand, friendly, and nerdy (like D&amp;D kind of nerdy).Boring lectures, useless ppt decks, not sure what he is doing on class.Amazing professor with great lectures. He tells you exactly what you need to know more clearly and concisely than any other professor I&#39;ve had. Some things can be unclear if you learn them on your own so try to pay attention and follow along in lecture if you can.Excellent teacher and a great guy. He makes the class interesting and he loves to go above and beyond teaching just what will be on the test.Very entertaining, thoroughly enjoyed his lectures but they require a lot of outside work to understandGenuinely interested in helping students. He is very difficult to get a hold of and horrible about responding to email. Assignments are WAY too much work for a 3 credit class. Still he is an AWESOME prof and great guy.HES SO HOT!!!!Some people will hate his style of &#39;you program from scratch&#39;, but I believe his style of teaching ensures that you don&#39;t forget the material. If you&#39;re taking CS 2110 for kicks, unrecommended prof. But if you truly want to learn the material, Bailey will teach you and you WILL learn.Really good at really learning the material.  Homework will take you forever though.  So make sure you start on the assignments right away.The class overall is very interesting and can be fun if you enjoy Java and learning object-oriented programming. I found Birman&#39;s lectures quite boring and dull and ended up learning most of the material on my own time by reading the lecture notes that were put online. You probably would not need to attend class.If you do not intend to major in CS or not interested in spending all your time on java, do yourself a favor,please please don&#39;t take his class. There&#39;s no grading scheme, syllabus in his class. He is very difficult to get a hold of and doesn&#39;t respond to email. You will learn the stuff, but not from him.He knows what he&#39;s doing. Your grade is basically based on the two prelims but you also have to do well on the assignments. The final is optional, and if you don&#39;t take it you just get the grade you have thus far, which is nice.I really liked him. He gave most of the lectures. Seemed to genuinely care about teaching. I wish there had been more variety to the projects though.Very approachable outside of class. Not a hard course if you&#39;ve taken CS 1110Pretty much what everyone else said. His lectures are pretty clear actually although he goes off topic a lot, no organization. Horrible getting in touch way. Didn&#39;t grade prelim 2 until after school ended and final test grades came out. And I SWEAR that the final class grade was based solely on the final test, many classmates agree.Bailey is the man.Kozen was awesome. Assignments were pretty long but he gave so much help. He was constantly answering questions (in detail) both in person and on Piazza, the online Q+A site for the course. The prelims were unbelievably fair, especially compared to previous ones on the website. He made the course relatively painless, and was also interesting.do not take 2110 with this guy. project instructions were horrific. tests were ok, though. wait for an easier professorHe is an ok professor but it is not easy to follow his logic in lectures since he spends a lot of time talking about himself and his own research. Exam questions were somewhat unclear and it is not always easy to understand what is required from the student. In his course, prelims are very heavily weighted while assignment almost have no weight.Snippy when it comes to answering questions (online), but his answers try to encourage independent student learning; don&#39;t expect a polite answer if you ask about something that you can google\/check the course materials for yourself.Not someone I would want to be friends with.  Very arrogant, not helpful.  The class is doable but projects do not relate to lecture.Gries is a good teacher, he&#39;s just really old and sometimes you just get really bored. The assignments are fun and straightforward, prelims straightforward, and final optional. I enjoyed his class!Gries is a very nice and helpful professor. The material in his class gives us a very good foundation for our future study in Computer Science. He is very patient when you ask him questions . One of best professors in Cornell. Awesome professor. Lectures were extremely interesting; he did a great job explaining the material. You can tell he loves teaching.Teaches well, and makes lecture interesting. Personally answers a lot of questions on Piazza. The assignments are not trivial, but you have more than enough time and resources (the course staff) to finish them. Tests are very fair, and grading is pretty generous. I regret buying the textbook though -- I never used it.Let alone his teaching skills, if theres one person who gave me a whole new vision of computer science, Professor Gries is that person. He&#39;s single handedly the happiest person and best professor I have met. Being a student of his has been an absolute pleasure, and Im truly grateful.Gries is one of my favorite professors at Cornell so far. You can tell he cares about students and teaching a lot. He is the kind of professor who tries to do everything himself to make sure students understand class materials, for example, monitoring piazza all the time and answering all questions almost. He doesn&#39;t leave teaching tasks to TA&#39;s.Lectures are vague; he goes over material too quickly. He&#39;ll help you, but only if you ask intelligent questions. He gets angry easily, especially if you neglect something he&#39;s already said somewhere sometime. Curves are not really nice.Gries is the most helpful and condescending professor I know. Will help you but be prepared to feel stupid if you have a question. Not too difficult overall and is a good lecturer as well.He&#39;s a good professor, very knowledgeable about the subject, and clearly interested in teaching. In person, he&#39;s very sweet and helpful. (But online, sometimes he seems rude and impatient...?)He has dumbed down 2110 to the point where it is basically intro to java. The assignments are step by step guides to writing a useless program. What&#39;s supposed to be a course that introduces Object Oriented programming and prepares students to get an internship at a CS company, is now a complete joke.Lectures were pretty interesting. Projects were short and overall the class wasn&#39;t that much work.Does not prepare anything substantial for class. 90% of what comes out of his mouth during lecture is useless information. Never updates the class website. The students have no idea what he plans to do(if he even has a plan). Simply put, he is not qualified to teach cs 2110 and brings shame to the cs department.I usually just read comments and never give my own, but I feel an urge to leave my comment for the first time. I couldn&#39;t believe that there are so many bad comments about Gries. He is one of the best professors I&#39;ve ever had  at Cornell. Passionate, knowledgeable, and extremely willing to help students out. A sweet old guy.Tough class and the lectures were not overly engaging\/interesting. Still, Professor Gries knows his work very well and pioneered the field of loop invariants. TAs were helpful even though they graded pretty harshly.Walker White is an amazing professor, the best one I&#39;ve had at Cornell so far. CS 1110 is very well-structured and the lectures are on-point. After the class I felt that I had a great foundation in CS and was confident in my abilities going into CS 2110. Ditto.Class was very difficult and lectures were little to no help for assignments and prelims. Final is optional which is good, but can hurt you if you choose to take it.  Prelim medians were very difficult making the median very low, but the way Gries curves the class is somewhat confusing. Hardest class I&#39;ve ever taken.The exams make up the majority of your grade. When doing the assignments, make sure you REALLY know what you&#39;re doing, and understand what&#39;s going on if you&#39;re working with a partner.He&#39;s one of the greatest professors I have ever had. He has such extensive knowledge about the subject and is always ready to help. He is easily accessible outside the class. He can come across as a bit condescending if you ask &#34;dumb&#34; questions but ignore that.He was okay - he clearly understood what he was doing, and was willing to help but his Piazza responses were often terse and bordered on rude.  The class was not very challenging overall - the later parts, which mattered more, were not tested much and not necessary for a good grade in the class.Professor Gries is one of the most caring professors. His lecture slides are well-written, and he provides student opportunities to have lunch with him. The workload is fairly light and the prelims are reasonable. His lectures are pretty good and he answers almost every piazza question super fast.Sometimes comes across weird on Piazza, but a very good lecturer and makes great resources for students in CS 2110.The professor was really great! He was helpful and responsive! He replied Piaaza questions very quickly.Bad lecturer, good 1-1 teacher. Do the assignments to learn, but they have little to no impact on your grade; only the prelims matter. Had Bs on the prelims, A+ on assignments (above the mean on most) but still got a B. Things change from semester to semester (i.e. assignments, pace etc) but all lectures content-wise are on videonote.One of the best professors I had at Cornell.He makes the material too hard. He has a genuine desire to help students but just doesn&#39;t succeed.This guy is really the worst. Literally zero resources available in either class I took with him, he won&#39;t even give a syllabus or set up a course website. Loves to hear himself talk and always winds up overcomplicating things in the lecture\/assumes people understand things that haven&#39;t been taught. &#34;Open ended&#34; HW just means there&#39;s no guidelines.He is a pretty good lecturer. He is an interesting guy with a super nice personality. Definitely learned a lot in this class. Only complaint is that sometimes his Piazza answers are rushed and unclear.The prelims are what actually decide your grade in this class. Gries provides a lot of information to help you succeed on these tests though. He provides a list of concepts and a lot of practice exams. He also answers question on piazza very quickly. His answers are very direct, but not rude (even when the questions are pretty rude).","difficulty":3.1518987342,"rating":3.5696202532},{"index":1654,"prof_name":"David Gries","prof_dept":"Computer Science","class_name":"CS2111","comment":"The man is an absolute boss.

He is also friendly in Office hours, if you have any questions about the course. Take his class if you want to be challenged like never before.He put in a special effort in remembering everyone&#39;s name, and that&#39;s really something. Extremely organized lectures. Exams were fair. Projects were hard (120 hours of coding for the whole semester). Lots of fun.Professor Myers is knowledgeable and his lectures are amazing. He might get a bad rep because his classes are hard, but hes extremely helpful and is always willing to answer your questions either after class or during office hours. And if you cant make it to his office hours, he has a website where you can book an appointment with him.Really hard but one of the best teachers I&#39;ve ever had.Extremely concise lectures; very well delivered. Took 2112 as a freshmen- it was not an easy ride, but I definitely learned a lot thanks to Kozen. Very rewarding class. The assignments require a lot of energy and time, but Kozen is always there to help his students.CS2112 was the hardest class I&#39;ve ever taken. The material is hard, but the real killer is the sheer volume of work. You will devote a huge amount of time and energy to this class, and then still feel like that is not enough. This class probably broke me. I learned a lot, but it was not worth the stress and anguish. DO NOT TAKE as a freshman!!!!Lectures were always very clear and interesting and were a good learning experience. Taking the honors course resulted in a hefty load with seemingly unreasonable projects and deadlines. In the end was worth it. Prof. Myers was always very helpful when we had questions as was the rest of the course staff. Take this course if you want a challenge!!Fun lecturer but also good for snooze if necessaryVery good lecturer, although the class was extremely difficult. Class was worthwhile.I love the guy so much. He&#39;s a genius.  Don&#39;t mix up the courses with the teacher. Let&#39;s separate the two:  Professor Myers is: Well spoken, focuses on big picture, focuses on good programming, understands everything. Nice.  The classes he teaches are: honors\/heavy duty CS courses at Cornell University. HW is 10+ a week. Lube is advised.Good teacher. Explains well and helpful if you ask for clarification. Assignments are long but the grading is quite generous.&#34;It&#39;s not about the points&#34; - Kozen Definitely one of the better professors. His lectures are clear, concise, and easy to follow, and the projects he assigned were meaningful, interesting, and some of the most fun I&#39;ve ever had at school. At times, the grading felt a bit arbitrary, but the massive curve at the end rendered it all irrelevant.Amazing professor who actually cares about you!! Good lecturer. 2112 was ridiculously hard and definitely caused me way too much stress and hair loss. But I would take it again for sure because you learn so much. Exams are not bad at all, just memorize lecture and recitation notes.

He likes teaching and does it well.He teaches everything at an &#34;honors&#34; level, meaning it will be much harder than you expected it to be. The TAs for this class don&#39;t even know how to do some of these homework problems. He is willing to help though. But your life will be hell forHe&#39;s a genius, MacArthur style (look it up). Willing to go back over any logic and try and make it more intuitive for you. Great lecturer.halpern is a very good 280 professor.  most of his lectures are interesting and well done, he&#39;s very enthusiastic about the material and it shows.  i thought that i&#39;d hate this class but it ended up being one of my favorites.Most caring and entertaining professor of all time... where &#34;caring&#34; := &#34;He puts amazing effort into making assignments that eat away your free time,&#34; and &#34;entertaining&#34; := &#34;You will be so confused by his assignments thaCovers easy material clearly and quite humorously in lectures, and then applies to to rediculously hard homework assignments.  Luckely, he bases grades mostly on the prelims, which are quite fair.Bailey is a great lecturer. He explains things, which are inherently complicated, in an understandable manner without really sacrificing any rigor. Homework assignments are typically difficult (especially group\/graph theory) but the grading is lenient.I really enjoyed these lectures. He is really interesting to listen to and is really accessible to answer questions. I only wish he wouldn&#39;t dim the lights so much during the lectures...its hard to stay awake in the dark regardless of how interested you are.Best CS professor I&#39;ve had, period. Very, very smart, and very good at explaining the material (I tried taking the same course when Tardos was teaching it...had to drop it), which made the class pretty straightforward and fun. He&#39;s funny, too :) If you have any interest in a class he teaches, TAKE IT!Expects a LOT from the students, no one really gets it. Dresses kinda funny. Just don&#39;t try to &#34;get it&#34; too much and you will be ok.Avoid at ALL COST.Bailey is a genius, and in his course you will be expected to be a genius as well.  He is a fun guy though, and I must say I learned a lot in his class.  He cares about students&#39; progress and at the end of the day is relatively generous with grades.The rebel king is alive and well!I heard him say &#34;I&#39;m doing my time in the trenches with the undergrads this term.&#34;The class was rather hard and he didn&#39;t seem to be much help.  He was in some band I forget the name of -- I never spent time outside class but he was in a band wiHe took over the couse for 1 semester. i think he ruined the class. the stuff i knew how to do i knew it from other classes. i think skipped about 13-15 lectures, and got A+. if you just want a free A, and not learn anything and be screwed later, go for it.He really is a genius.  He always has an answer to any question immediately but he explains things very well and it makes sense.  Even though the material is hard he is very helpful and a great lecturer.excellent teacher, noble guy.Fantastic at teaching. Great explanation of the material. Very smart man!This guy is the CS GOD!!!Incredibly intelligent, cares deeply about his subject and teaching.  Requires some mathematical sophistication, but that never hurt anyone.  The class is a great survey of some interesting theoretical subjects and their applications to modern computer science.Bailey&#39;s CS 280 was the hardest class I&#39;ve ever took. But, I love Bailey.. he&#39;s the sweetest professor ever. I guess he just thought everyone in class is a genius, which unfortunately isn&#39;t the case, even in an ivy league university.","difficulty":3.1818181818,"rating":4.2727272727},{"index":1664,"prof_name":"Michael George","prof_dept":"Computer Science","class_name":"CS2800","comment":"He really cares about his students. HW once a week &amp; requires office hours for full score but enlightening. Answers questions clearly during lecture. I&#39;d say everyone was really greatful they took the class and learned so many things UNTIL he absolutely shafted everyone on the final.Love this guy!! Very fun lectures, and definitely my favorite class at Cornell so far.  He is extremely clear and exciting to listen to, and his prelims and final exam are very very straight forward if you pay attention.  I wish he taught every CS class here I took. Awesome.Prof. Pass is the moon. Thus, he is a cheese. A lot of interesting topics are covered in this class that should get you thinking. HWs are a little hard sometimes, but the exams are usually easier than the HWs. Pass is very funny and incorporates good examples into each lecture. Real world applications are discussed. He has cool hair and a scarf.I learned to think in a very different way after taking his discrete math class. Once my brain clicked, I could easily understand what was going on. His homeworks can be a bit on the hard side but with deep understand it is doable. His tests are easier than homeworks but deal with the same concepts. I could have got A\/A+ if I wasn&#39;t careless.Clear lectures. Only criticism I have is that some long proofs would be done quickly and people would have tons of questions afterwards. But he&#39;s smart and answers all questions very well. Ithaca is Georges. Don&#39;t skip lectures.He&#39;s devoted to teaching and his students. However, not a good lecturer at all. He basically just recites all the definitions and problem solutions without explaining.Pass is the man. It takes a lecture or two to understand his accent but once you&#39;ve got that you have one of the best professors at Cornell teaching a subject he&#39;s a master at. He&#39;s incredibly nice and great at explaining things.Not sure why there&#39;re so many low reviews for Prof George. I had him in the fall (2016) and he was a great lecturer. He writes proofs from scratch rather than just blindly teaching it, which was very helpful. Tests and homeworks were fair; go to office hours if you get stuck. I really enjoyed 2800 with Mike George and would take any class with himVery clear and concise. However, the course covers only the very basics of a lot of math\/CS topics in such a brief amount of time; it feels like nothing is really well developed. Since the problems are fairly involved grading is hand-wavy at times and it&#39;s possible to get a good grade without really knowing the topic well, which can be frustrating.Wonderful guy, great class. If this is your first proof-based math class, you need to put in time outside of class to think through proofs and logic on your own. Working through the first couple chapters of an intro number theory textbook over break is a good way to prepare. Also, plenty of support in terms of piazza and office hours.He is soooo helpful that although he does not usually hold office hours (they got cancelled easily), he even tend to help us when he can, for instance, teaching us automata during a trip to Orlando, telling us about number theory even down in the deep water there with a scuba He is certainly able to explain problems well when he wanna do so.I honestly did not go to lecture pretty much ever and still got an A because he posts such detailed lecture notes and reading online. If you use the online resources and study super hard right before tests, you&#39;ll be fine. pretty fun class!Professor George&#39;s lectures and lecture notes are were often unclear and difficult to follow due to his sometimes awkward notation choices and barely legible handwriting. Moreover, many of the homework problem sets were made very difficult by going far beyond what was taught in class.Enthusiastic teacher, lecture notes are extremely well written and helpful.Mike George is a great teacher if you pay attention in class. He writes down notes in class on his IPad which is projected on a screen, which makes the lecture easy to follow. This course is hard to do well in if you don&#39;t attend lecture, but if your attendance is good and you put in effort, you will do well.His lectures are not well-explained. He defines terms and concepts in his vague own words and I often don&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. Weekly homework. Hated 2800 because his lectures were so boring but when I went to TA office hours, the stuff turned out to be actually interesting. He somehow managed to make cool stuff so boring and confusingI have never met a worse professor in my life. This course taught by him is literally harder than all the courses I have taken at Cornell combined. Not only is he extremely unclear during lecture,his homework is also nothing but a torture to do, if not just to look at. I learnt nothing from himGreat professor. Really enjoyed his lectures. Super helpful during the office hour.Can&#39;t figure out what his logic is in his lectures. He uses all sorts of fancy notations with no clear explanations, which only confuse us.If you are a math major or are used to mathematical proofs then refrain from going to lectures because they will confuse you and mess up your mathematical thinking. He uses all kinds of ridiculous ways to teach math, including inventing his own problematic problems. His homework often makes little sense, and so does his logic.Nice person, mediocre professor, hard homework, even harder exams.He is a lovely guy, but his lectures sometimes make little sense. He obviously makes effort to teaching, but he likes inventing his own problems which hardly makes sense. It might be better to be more organized during lectures in presenting his materials.Countless errors, typos  and confusion in lectures, lecture notes and problems. A proof course should not be imprecise like this.Student understanding is not a high priority in his lectures. I see little work and little development as a teacher. He uses a mix of complicated notation and  arbitrary wording in both homework and lectures, explaining them in no easy terms, further confusing the students.I&#39;ve had 2 classes with him. My favorite professor at Cornell. Rafael is GOD! &#39;nough saidMichael George is honestly a very good professor who teaches my favorite class at Cornell thus far.  During class, George would always stop to answer any and all questions about his proofs just to make sure everyone was following along.  The only times I got lost a bit weren&#39;t things that we were tested on.  There&#39;s a lot of really cool material!If you take this class assuming that lecture won&#39;t help you, you will do better. Lecture is only helpful if you also use the textbook (but I recommend using &#34;Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications&#34; by Rosen because there are examples and it&#39;s more user-friendly). Notes are uploaded online but honestly won&#39;t help you because you can&#39;t read themGreat professor. Engaging in lectures and very dedicated to making sure every student is learning the material. Homework can occasionally be time consuming, but are also very rewarding and worth the hard work.He&#39;s a pretty nice guy. i can see that he came prepared. but his handwriting is undecipherable. he don&#39;t use slides instead using some sort of ipad which is pretty unclear. Compared to another lecturer Joe, his lec is pretty dull. 2800 have many interesting  concepts and challenges, but he approach them in a rather bland way.The worst professor I had at Cornell. Homework takes immeasurable amount of time a lot of which you will spend in overcrowded office hours, and is also way above the level of the lectures. Lecturing is confusing, and he already assumes you know a lot of stuff.Michael George is very good at explaining things in CS 2800. He goes through proofs in detail and is also extremely helpful during Office hours; I think a lot of people don&#39;t like him because they don&#39;t like the class, rather than the fact that they don&#39;t like him.Very disorganized and unclear lecturer. Homework content not stressed well in exams or any relevant readings. Essential to have a good team of people to work on assignments in order to survive class with him.Lectures are pretty clear and straightforward. Material isn&#39;t that complicated but takes a lot of work, memorization, and attention to detail. Homeworks are long and actually require effort (took 4-6 hours but I also never went to OH). He seems like a nice guy? Pedantic (but you have to be for this subject) and knows what he&#39;s doing, wants to help.I personally really liked 2800 with Professor George. Prior to 2800, I never formally learned how to prove things, but he made it much more understandable in terms of what makes a solid proof and what techniques to use. One thing that helped me: redo in-class proofs without notes. Lectures do get a lil rough (esp in Uris G01), but it&#39;s worth going!Lectures do not cover the materials that the PSets and the exams are on. His lectures were also super boring and he sometimes moved through too quickly. It&#39;s a running joke among CS majors that 2800 is a hellhole that you somehow need to get through. Thank god there&#39;s a new prof this year; hopefully, she does a better job.THE BEST! Congratulations to Dr. Halpern on being elected to the National Academy of Engineering!Awesome guy awesome teacherI took Discrete Structures with Hopcroft and found it very unorganized. The textbook barely helped, and the information given was inconsistent (Only a couple lectures had notes online and homework answers stopped being given to us halfway through the semester.) Prelims were easy enough, but course overall was not very goodGreat guy, and brilliant. Not very organized, and the lecture was too large for him to handle, but he really does care about teaching...which is pretty cool considering how distinguished the guy is.Terrible professor. Brilliant, but terrible at conveying information. Extremely unorganized and assumes everyone in the room has already seen half of the material. Essentially taught myself the course, but it was not very hard. 2800 is much easier with Hopcroft but he will not teach you anythingLectures can be a little disorganized, but prof is extremely approachable and helpful during office hours. Course gets easier towards end of semester. Reasonable HW sets, easy prelims if you&#39;ve been paying attention to the HWs.He is a genius of a professor. However, because of that he often taught way above the level of the class. People frequently had no idea what he was talking about in lecture, and sometimes his co-professor would even be confused about what he was explaining. I can&#39;t recommend his lectures in good faith.Hard material, but a GREAT professor. One of the smartest guys at Cornell, which is saying a lot. Lectures can be a little slow, but he will answer any questions, and really knows his stuff.Graeme Bailey is an incredible lecturer. Really passionate about the material and very accommodating to any issue you might have.  Class if really really difficult for the material covered and requires a lot of time for hw...office hours necessary. If you want an awesome teacher and difficult class, recommendHe&#39;s really into the subject, while the students not as much.  Didn&#39;t go to lectures, didn&#39;t need to.  Problem Sets from book, only need to read the book to understand.  Midterm (only one) and final were pretty fair.Michael George is not the best lecturer, though the lectures are important. But he goes out of his way to help students outside of class, so take advantage of his office hours.George is maybe not the best lecturer by any means, however he is extremely caring. He ran weekly review sessions on Tuesday nights to recap the last week&#39;s material and his prelim and final exam review sessions were immensely helpful. Homework was pretty brutal and some of the exams were absurdly difficult. That being said, the curve is generous.This guy is the worst. Clearly from reviews on this site no one goes to his useless lectures, now he makes them mandatory. A professor&#39;s insecurities about his\/her teaching ability really show when they force their students to listen to them speak and half of their course website is about academic integrity violations since no one does the work.He does a pretty good job of teaching the course actually. He makes a good effort at explaining and teaching a difficult subject.suppppppper unclear and the hw sometimes get extremely hard!!!!Great Professor. Seems really boring and hard to hear his voice, but if you pay close attention, he is amazing. Very helpful, ask a lot of questions to get the best result out of him!Professor George explains things really well. He states things very clearly and takes questions seriously. But exams are very very loaded.He seems like he kind of cares but his lectures are just so boring. CS2800 is really interesting but he makes it unnecessarily difficult and frustrating.I have been in this class for four classes, and havent learned one thing.Horrible professor. You are better off not attending lecture; he doesn&#39;t explain his proofs well at all. Notes are horrible to read from, so they&#39;re garbage. Some of the TAs also don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about. I would attend office hours every week for at least 12 hours and would not receive any insightful help from certain TAs. Horrendous.Had him for 2800. Hes a moderately engaging professor. He explained things well - many of the topics were new to me. It was a big class, but he complained if students were late\/talking, which I guess is his prerogative. He does try to make the material relevant from both a math-CS and an industry-CS perspective. psets are 8-10 hrs - start early.Homework is impossible and at a substantially higher level than the what is taught in lecture.

Maybe it was made easy by Easley and Kleinberg&#39;s ability to teach, but truthfully I don&#39;t think teaching this material would be challenging for anyone. I would love to see what Easley could do in an intense economics course. He seems very smart and very personable.great class, interesting topics,  easy to understandKleinberg is so smart. Too bad I didn&#39;t get to see his true genius in a course as easy as networks.

Definitely a very difficult class, but he genuinely cares about the learning of all of his students, and he has been working really hard to accommodate and help us in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.Foster was (thus far) my favorite professor at Cornell. Engaging, friendly, and incredibly committed to the course and its students. Even with the difficult transition to online learning this spring, he took enormous initiative to rapidly convert a class designed for in-person instruction into one that worked beautifully online. Highly recommend!The best professor I&#39;ve had so far at Cornell. Foster is not only extremely knowledgeable about functional programming and PL in general, but is genuinely caring about his students and has done a really good job this semester in dealing with the pandemic while maximizing our learning. Both 3110 professors are top-notch!Prof. Foster is extraordinarily kind and extremely intelligible, but he is also quite busy compared to other professors. Unfortunately, CS 3110 is now a pale shadow of its former self, and many formerly important topics are no longer covered in great depthYou can actually learn in this class.I love Nate Foster! He is so passionate about the material and he presents it in a very clear manner. After lecture on Valentine&#39;s day, he had the tas hand out OCaml pickup lines and chocolates. I&#39;m taking this class during the coronavirus pandemic, and Foster has really shown how much he cares for the wellbeing of students. Ta&#39;s also very helpful.This guy pays just too much attention on coding style and will deduct your marks unwarned because of that. I got a C... Though good teaching anyway.A beautiful mindCS 3110 has cool material, but far too much work. Lectures are in general not too useful as concepts are presented much more simply than is necessary to get an understanding good enough for the prelims. Projects are too long, and since many of them are group projects, getting a good group is absolutely essential.Foster believes in the potential of every student. His course is difficult, but he provides excellent resources in order to ensure that anyone can succeed. My favorite professor in the CS department.the best professor so far at cornellAn amazing professor. The lectures are very fun, and while the course is hard his teaching style will help you do well.Professor Foster is the nicest, most accommodating professor I have had so far. Although the class is difficult, he works hard to make sure everyone is comfortable in the class and even puts fun music and puns into lectures. Even tho im prob gnna fail the class Great guy and does his best help with understanding 10\/10 love him xoxoGood guy. Extremely intelligent and knows what he&#39;s talking about. Helps you out when necessary. Assignments are incredibly tough and long but definitely enjoyable and educational.Phenomenal professor and phenomenal class. Clarkson made online learning so much fun. Every part of the course was so well done. The lectures, assignments, and projects were all extremely interesting and extremely educational. So much respect for Clarkson.Great lecturer with a passion for functional programming and even more so for teaching.  Plays a different song related to the class topic each day, and then made a playlist available on spotify at the end of the year.  Some lectures he comes dressed in costumes and makes the lectures very fun and engaging, as well as very easy to follow.HE IS THE BESTThe material is very well structured and very, very detailed. The workload is heavy, but this has been my favorite class so far in Cornell.Simply not the best.Hard course taught with a lot of jargonLectures are boring and disorganized. He frequently goes off on tangents too. The hardest part about this class though is that what we are taught and what we are expected to know are completely different. The TAs teach us using last year&#39;s notes. That&#39;s the only way that we learn anything.I did not like the lack of organization on the HWs and exams. TAs write the HWs and half of each exam. I was told the class gets harder every year. With 5 minutes left on each prelim, we got 15-30 extra minutes, but no extra time on the final, so don&#39;t expect it all the time. Overall, that made me feel a lack of trust. Do well on the final.His first time teaching in years.  Lectures were not pertinent much and not updated online until right before final.  Problem Sets were managed solely by the TAs.  Prelims were fine.  Grade in class is almost solely based on final, as stated by email afterwards.  He&#39;s a decent person, but do try to stay away as far as class goes.Great lecturer.Extremely careless about classes. Lecture notes are updated 1 month later (Those for the finals haven&#39;t been updated yet).I learned so much from his course, it blew my mind. I didn&#39;t appreciate the difference between just knowing how to code and actually understanding the principles of cs before taking this course.Worst CS class I have ever taken at Cornell. Lectures are extremely disorganized and topics is not typical CS at all (to me, I believe for theory ppl it might be more interesting). He is a nice guy, though.Prof. Clarkson is very intelligent and humorous. The assignments are great and fun and are of acceptable difficulty. I learned so much in his class, although I have to admit that I sometimes felt sleepy during the lecture:) Also, it&#39;s extremely hard to get an A... even if you are above the median of A range.Professor Clarkson is very knowledgable, but his classes are pretty difficult.Very clear and easy to understand lectures. Funny and nerdy. Very understanding and sympathetic in COVID times. In my experience (and in the experience of a couple of friends), can come across curt in emails (not as much in Campuswire posts, but increasingly so as the semester goes on). Textbook used but necessity is arguable.Amazing man, and amazing professor. He really cares about his students, and his lecturing style is engaging - he is clearly passionate about the subject matter, and conveys that passion to students. Grading criteria is very straightforward, but make sure you actually follow the rubric. All in all, if you can take a class with him, do it.By far the worst professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Lectures were extremely disorganized. He often went off on tangents during one lecture, and then went off on the same tangents during the following lecture, and so on. I felt that I learned nothing from his class, and relied entirely on the TAs in recitation for my understanding of the material.Michael Clarkson is the best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell. He knows OCaml like the back of his hand, and unlike several other professors, he can explain the material in a very straightforward and interesting way. I highly recommend taking this class with Clarkson.He&#39;s the best professor I&#39;ve ever had. In my entire life. Like, seriously.

He wants everyone to do well and goes beyond what the majority of the rest of the faculty  would do to achieve this goal. Some people complain that his lectures are unclear, but he releases them a day early so you can skim them before class to make up for it. +1 to him.He has no idea what he is doing!Awful and unclear lectures, can only learn from textbook.Bracy is an excellent lecturer and really cares about her students. That doesn&#39;t mean the assignments and prelims aren&#39;t insanely hard...Hakim is a smart guy who is very approachable. However, the class itself disinterests me, and I dont think this has anything to do with him. As a result, I didn&#39;t spend as much time on this class as it demands, therefore, I am not blaming anyone.Most boring lecturer ever. Worst prof Ive ever had here.Clear lecturer who&#39;s very passionate about the subject, and makes many references to Wegmans during the lectures. Went through numerous examples during class when covering more complex topics like caches, and reduced the difficulty of the assignments to accomodate for a hybrid class format. Had a reasonable slip day policy for project submissions.He is very knowledgeable and it seems his goal is to help his students do well.  Class might be difficult at first, but bare with him and do all the assignments and you will do well.  He also has a great personality and is very approachable.Bracy is a great teacher and clearly knows her subject. Her lectures are well-designed with clear language and she drops hilarious lines from time to time. This class covered a lot of highly technical details and sub-regions of CS, and not attending the lectures would make it hard to understand the slides. That said, the textbook is comprehensive.Terrible person. I was hospitalized for a week and she forced me to use all of my slip days instead of just granting an extension like a human with empathy.Professor Bracy&#39;s class was so incredibly difficult for the sole purpose of being difficult. Lectures move so incredibly fast, projects have virtually no guidance and are difficult, and exams are not super related to projects and are still hard. I did more work for this class than any of my others classes and was miserable for each second of it.Course is very poorly managed. Details\/busy work interfere with the course content.Professor Bracy is one of the best professors I&#39;ve had at Cornell. I took a class with her, and also was a TA for another class that she taught. Her classes definitely aren&#39;t easy, but she really cares about giving her students the best possible experiences and does everything that she can to help them succeed. Would definitely recommend her.CS 3410 is a mandatory CS class and Bracy made it as painless as possible. As long as you make use of all the resources, you should be fine.One of the best professor at cornell! Homeworks can be a little disorganized but her lectures are always interesting, informative, and entertaining.I don&#39;t know whether my negative experience with prof bracy owes itself more to the overbearing nature of the class (and I mean this class approaches levels of work akin to 19th century industrial revolution standards of labor), or to her stone cold, stoic conveyance of the material. Bracy was relentless and didn&#39;t even try to help make it palatablGo to office hours. Nothing in lecture can even compare to the evils of Logisim and malloc.I took ece 2300 with David Albonesi(whose notes are ece bible) and cs 3410 with Bracy. The lecture note is unclear, messy and full of small errors. The lecture is  also unclear, messy and full of small erros. Bracy  loves using analogy to make the material less bland, but  3410 material is something that requires accurate and technical language!!Great teacher, affable.Take 3420As Anne Bracy describes it, CS 3410 is like &#34;trying to drink from two firehoses.&#34; This class is a TON of work, and the concepts are very hard. However, Bracy teaches them really well. She knows her stuff, and can answer any question you throw at her. This class will be near impossible, but Bracy and the TA army will help you out.Wow, Bracy yourself for 3410 cause it&#39;s the bomb dot com. While the projects\/ homework aren&#39;t too hard, they are time consuming. The 3410 TA army and Bracy is there for you though, so you are in good hands.Fun lectures that fly over topics at the speed of light. Be sure to read up before lecture begins (there&#39;s HW before every lecture to help with that) and take notes like a good student. Tests are difficult and annoying as they often test a concept that you know well but contorted so that no one knows how to answer. Still, great, fun person.Super difficult class, but the best proffessor I&#39;ve had at cornellGreat Professor. The lectures are very clear. Attend the classes since It takes more time to figure out the lecture note than just attending the class. Not sure why are there so many very negatives comments. I took 4410 in the Fall semester. The lectures are a bit slow and repetitive and the projects are pretty difficult. But t&#39;s fine overall.I really loved cs3410 with her :) I maybe only scraped past tests, but it was worth it for the interesting lecture and great content.Bracy is an amazing lecturer and made this class (which could have been terrible) pretty enjoyable and interesting. I really loved her classes and thought the assignments were pretty standard for a CS core class. Also, she&#39;s awesome to talk to outside of class and genuinely cares about her students. 10\/10 would recommend!Professor Bracy is a talented and funny lecturer. Her lectures explain material extremely well while also being fairly concise. CS 3410&#39;s projects were hard (10-20 hours per project) and its exams harder, with means around a 55\/90. I would highly recommend taking her classes she teaches.Textbook is your best friend in the class. Otherwise, you are all alone.Bracy is a god among men. Never have I seen such a professor so passionate about both the material and her students. She gets so excited teaching and talking with students that it makes lectures my favorite time of the week. Yes, the class is difficult and condensed, but if you pay attention in lecture, the class is very manageable. SHE IS AMAZING!He consistently delivered lectures as though he were seeing the slides for the first time. He was notoriously bad last semester, and this was evidenced by the consistently low scores (around 50&#39;s) of the tests.

Homeworks were straightforward and followed directly from the lectures. There was a textbook but I did not use it.Trummer was a below average professor. His lectures were tough to understand.

I just learned that instructor assignments can also have seg faults, HW grades are arbitrary, and remember kids, in a hard drive, the head spins. Clearly knows what he&#39;s doingProf. Alvisi is one of the nicest, most passionate guys you&#39;ll meet, but unfortunately this doesn&#39;t translate to clear lectures. I left many classes more confused than when I came in. Not to mention, most of the taught material isn&#39;t even helpful for the test problems, which all seem arbitrary and unrelated to the course material.Constantly rambles during lecture instead of sticking to explaining the course material. Is a bad explainer of concepts and makes content harder than it actually is. Tests are only slightly based on lecture material. Mean on one test was less than 45%. Unfair tests with bad grading criteria.Do not take his 4410 class. If I have to regret ever taking one class in Cornell, it will have to be this. Honestly abysmal. Tests were not demonstrative of the lecture material.the tests were rough and the curve didn&#39;t come through like I hoped, but the course was pretty enjoyable given that I hated 3410. the professor was an amazing lecturer and explained concepts well. he held review sessions every few weeks and cared a lot about the course. the tests were brutal and hard to study for but I would still recommend taking.Does not care about his students.Poor lectures, poor slides, few opportunities to practice and learn much of the material, unclear project specifications, and devilish exams.Not care about students at allNot good lecturer. Makes random analogies and slides are difficult to decipher. Exams are very difficult. I love the textbook though. He is a cool guy (has 4 motorcycles) but not an effective teacher.He has the most monotone voice ever. Also, he does not understand how to map students scores to grades. In one assignment, the median was 5\/35 and he did not curve it.Kinda a mean person. Lectures can be pretty dry too. He co-taught OS with RVR, and RVR was not only nicer, but also more engaging during lecture.His lectures are confusing, his explanations vague. He also doesn&#39;t have real lecture slides, they&#39;re just handwritten notes (which are even more incomprehensible than he is in person). 80k tuition and not even readable slides.... AVOID him for CS4410. He co-lectured with RVR and while I mostly always understand RVR, I rarely understand Schneider.What he taught can always make you confused, won&#39;t take his courses again.OS is very important, but obviouly he can hardly teach it well.Poor spoken English with terrible slides. And he will never answer your questions on Piazza.I blindly stumbled through this course, consistently failing with minimal support or feedback. Professor often seemed frustrated with students being so lost and wanted to improve but didn&#39;t know how, while students were frustrated our time wasn&#39;t respected. He does have potential, and I hope he takes some feedback and becomes a great professor!Awful slides along with worse teaching, and yeah very tough tests.Very poor teaching.The Professor make the exam too hard to handle (with mean 64\/120 and median 62\/120), alone with unclear lecture notes. Though I tried my best to review anything in the lecture, many problems seem like mysteries in the exam. I along with many of my friends decide not to take any course taught by this professor anymore!The professor is super smart and condescending. Course delivery is vague. Worst professor ever in four years.Awesome!Prof. Agarwal is one of the most amazing lecturers at Cornell. He is engaging, funny and keeps the class interactive. He cares so much about the students. He often stayed in his office until late and came back early morning to help us with home works. I hope he improves the course organization ( and have better TAs and co-instructor in future).New Professor. I find his enthusiasm and knowledge to be awesome. Was very unorganized, and this undermined the learning of this class by a lot. WIll hopefully get better soon!It was his first time teaching, and he did a great job in the lectures (some mistakes, but the lectures were very engaging). The class was unorganized, but he was very approachable, always ready to help and really cared about us students. There are very few other professors who stay in office until 11PM to help students and come back at 8AM.I learned OS in the 48 hours before the final exam, by studying from previous finals.  This professor provided support through unreasonable homeworks, vague expectations, and the assurance that &#34;grades don&#39;t matter&#34; right before he released low scores on 6 homeworks on the day the semester ended.  Enroll at your own risk.HAHAHA isn&#39;t it funny when you work all weekend to finish a project and then you get a month long extension because half the class didn&#39;t finish and you fail a prelim for another class  in the process. Good times. But in all seriousness, this class was pretty annoying. Being a guinea pig for a semester is not fun. Rachit said this would be fun :(.This was his first time teaching the class. I could fill a textbook with all the mistakes he made as a first time lecturer. But that won&#39;t matter because if this class has taught me anything, textbooks are worthless. Homeworks are largely just googling answers or begging TAs for help. Please take this class another semester if see this professor.The other responders are being a bit harsh; he&#39;s a nice\/helpful guy and his lectures were pretty good, but the class was poorly organized by him to the point where it was extremely frustrating. Blowing other deadlines to get this class&#39;s work done on time, only to have him constantly shift the due dates back, was unfair to say the least.He can make easy concepts hard to understand. Strong accent with unclear thought.Worst class I&#39;ve ever taken. Homeworks and projects were assigned randomly (we once had 2 Psets and 1 project due in one week). Repeatedly insisted the small details don&#39;t matter, just the underlying concepts, yet the homeworks and final exam both had really tedious questions that were never even touched on in lecture. Avoid at all costs.He&#39;s a nice person. But he is  just mediocre  at teaching. The lecture note and hw make little sense. some of the terms are vague. He definitely doesn&#39;t know the material himself...Overall, I wish there was more thought put into the course. Projects were not well planned, had too much time to complete, but little support. Having weekly problem sets would have helped students know what to focus on. Many difficult topics on the exams were covered in the book, but glossed on in lecture. Had to self-study to do well on exams.Best undergrad professor I&#39;ve had. She turned systems from a hated subject of mine into my graduate focus. Negative comments below are reactions to unconventional teaching. Lectures focus on concepts, exams are difficult but test your grasp of concepts in terms of big picture. Not a cookie-cutter professor\/lecturer - what makes her great.One of the worst classes I have taken.Awesome teaching with low scores. Think thoroughly before you enroll!!Great lectures are run like a large discussion, but often don&#39;t describe topics comprehensively enough for full coverage.  He really stimulates interest in OS though. Exams and grading are very hard.  Treat the lecture and prac as 4 credits each in terms of work load.NopeI really like Anne as a lecturer but this class was just awful. 3410 was good but 4410 was by far the worst class I&#39;ve taken at Cornell. I&#39;m not a big fan of the material to begin with and the fact that this class was a logistical nightmare did not alleviate that issue. I really hope they get it together.Little to no TAs use the piazza, and some of the answers are rather rude. Tests have means in the 50s and are unrelated to anything learned. Lectures have minimal overlap with projects, and the projects are very hazily laid out. For one project, we were told to simply google any questions. It&#39;s a shame this course is mandatory.Such an excellent class and Prof. Sirer is a phenomenal lecturer. He knows the material very well and if you go to class, read the book, and spend time on the assignments.. you will do fine. Exams are brutal, but the workload is not too bad. Overall, great course.. but don&#39;t expect to get an &#39;A&#39; grade.Despite Prof. Agarwal&#39;s messing up of the entire class, she was actually a good lecturer and you can tell from piazza and office hours that she actually cares and wants students to learn and succeed. She was organized and clear. 10\/10 would recommendBracy is unorganized, uncaring, and mean. Unwilling to help students and a very boring lecturer. In several instances, she would release grades for assignments 2 months after they were due. Her class organization is poor, has no accountability, and is not a good nor fair lecturer.Confusing lectures, need to read textbook...Never take 4410 with her. She clearly knows 3410 well, but completely messed up 4410 to the point of making (the very new) Prof. Agarwal look bad. She is mean and extremely useless in her office hours. She even co-organized the office hours for the two courses she was teaching that fall. Messed up the entire course and worst part were her lectures.Prof. Bracy is a great lecturer whose skill was sadly undermined by the incompetence of her co-professor.  I had her for both CS 3410 and this class, and I would say without a doubt that Prof. Bracy will go out of her way to help anyone who needs it, and is capable of much more than she was able to demonstrate in CS 4410 when I took it.Unintelligible class.Topics are in general interesting. Projects are enjoyable. However, project description is always vague (clarification is even 2 * longer than original description). Grading sometimes doesn&#39;t follow description quite well.The class is harder than it has to be. Concepts in lecture are briefly touched upon, with the majority of content being self-taught. Lectures and projects have little overlap, and tests are hard to predict. Bracy is good at teaching in lecture, but little of what she teaches is actually useful for the tests and projects.Very tough test, so many assignments that do not match it&#39;s credits. unclear lecture notes, skip the class? you will not clear about what leature notes talking about. besides operating system, the course also contains computer network and security. if you have choices, never choose it! it does not worth in any way!","difficulty":4.2040816327,"rating":1.9183673469},{"index":1697,"prof_name":"Yunhao Zhang","prof_dept":"Computer Science","class_name":"CS4411","comment":"Yunhao went out of his way to help his students understand and complete the projects.

One of the best professors at Cornell CS. His lectures are amazingly well crafted. He starts with the most fundamental questions and builds the entire protocol around those questions. It is clear how much Prof. Agarwal cares about students and about teaching. One of the best classes in my four years at Cornell.Prof. Agarwal is perhaps the best CS lecturer I&#39;ve had here. He starts from the basics and then builds up to more complex topics, but always goes back to foundational ideas to bring everything full circle. He&#39;s also willing to help students anytime after class hours. Tests can be tricky, but go to class and a good chunk of the questions are gimmesMinimal effort required outside of class, but attention required during class. Concepts are simple but tests are made really hard. Pop quizzes are easy as long as you pay attention in class. The most accessible professor in Cornell, willing to stay really late for office hour. I really like him as a professor.Every good rating in 4450 was done during the pandemic where 50% of their grade was a course eval. In normal times, your entire grade is based on exams, which are horribly written. He gives you ZERO prep for exams and the psets he does give have no relevance to the exams. Everyone bombed the first prelim and he did not curve the class. DO NOT TAKERachit is a nice guy, but actively misleads students about the difficulty of his tests. He will tell you that going to lecture is what it takes to succeed, but that is a lie. He gave us a prelim that was so hard that even the grad TAs said it was too difficult, and he still refused to curve the exam even though the median was a C.Amazing engaging lecturer. Really cares about the topic and makes it very interesting. Great low stress course. Optional Homeworks\/Projects. Only graded items are exams, which are really fair.

Most of the class is dedicated to classical computer vision, and the last few weeks are spent on ML topics.Excellent professor and can explain topics very clearly.

I think a lot of things changed for the Spring 2020 semester. I was surprised at the good lectures, clear slides, accessibility of the staff, improvement in HW quality and understanding that I was able to gain from this class. Haym has also been an extremely caring professor during the crisis.I have never taken a class this organized. First hw answers wasn&#39;t posted until a day before midterm. The midterm was basically the same as last years so half the class got 100s. Only 2 hws total, 3rd made extra credit bc it was due during finals. No practice questions for the exams after promising some. Nothing really to study from at all. A joke!Lectures are a bit dry, but he is a very nice guy, helpful and very approachable outside of class. He is definitely knowledgeable in AI and I believe it would be fun for someone who is really into the material.Somehow makes an interesting topic seem boring. Lectures were very dry. Hws and midterm were fairly easy. Don&#39;t know if I&#39;m just stupid, but final seemed to be ridiculously hard. Like way harder than anything we had seen before. Would not recommend.Very hard to understand.One of the worst professors I&#39;ve had at this school. Unorganized, consistently late, and somehow he manages to make everyone fall asleep while lecturing on an interesting topic.Most unorganized class I&#39;ve ever taken. Prof promised weekly hws, have gotten 3 (12\/15 weeks into semester). Office hours a mess because he doesn&#39;t provide TAs with intelligible HW solutions. Grade based on 2 tests (practice exams not helpful), and HWs which are hard to seek help for. Very apparent prof doesn&#39;t care about the course; stay away!Interesting material, great test review but hard exams, and a high though non-problematic level of disorganization. This class won&#39;t suck away too much time, too. At times when coursework is particularly heavy, Hirsh will give what amounts to a several-day extension on homework, and he provides many high-quality answers on Piazza.I took Prof Hirsh&#39;s class when the Covid-19 situation first started and he was very caring and thoughtful of the struggles students would be going through. He cancelled both the midterm and the final and replaced them with manageable weekly quizzes. Additionally, his lectures were very interesting and greatly increased my interest in AI.CS4700 was probably the worst class I took at Cornell. Everyone describes AI as an &#34;Easy A&#34; because the topics are simple, but the class is so unorganized and inconsistent that it is frustrating to prepare for it. Prof Hirsh seemed unprepared for class and his slides\/problem sets had many errors. To learn similar content, take CS 2110 and CS 4780.Incredibly disorganized. Boring, repetitive lectures on interesting topics. Put me to sleep every time. Lectures are vague and about the history of whatever we&#39;re discussing, but have no substance. Then the tests and homework are technical, which is unfair. Would not recommendNever seen any other professor is as responsible and patient as Prof. Hirsh.  His recitations and replies on piazza are super helpful. He is really a nice guy.I didn&#39;t go to lecture that much, but still did well on exams and homeworks. All you need to really do is study the powerpoint slides and notes from old CS 4700 websites to pass + go to exam reviews. Prof. Hirsh is a nice guy and good teacher, but the material in this course is pretty scarce so he ends up spending alot of time on simple topics.Poor lecturer, very disorganized. Tells class a homework will be released that night and then takes another 6 days to actually release it. Class itself is a joke, you won&#39;t learn anything but you will get an easy A. If you&#39;re a CS major, don&#39;t bother. If you&#39;re just looking to fulfill a requirement, I still wouldn&#39;t tbh.Before the class I had high expectation of both him and the subject (AI). However, after it I was disappointed about both. He has a weak understanding of the theories underlying the subject, and hence was unable to give helpful expositions. His ability of creating hypes and projecting confidence seemed to conceal much of the weakness - deplorable.The homeworks (there are about 6) are pretty helpful in understanding the material. There were also some good example problems provided before the exams last semester. Overall, the class was a lot better than what I&#39;d previously heard. The curriculum\/course structure has changed for the better, and Hirsh cares a lot about helping students learn.Good professor. May be his first time teaching AI in Cornell but he led the class pretty well. HWs are not so heavy and everyone could easily get full credit. Exams are a large portion of your grade, so do prepare. Usually the test questions are harder than HW, or tricker.   Professor is nice and spent a lot of time of Piazza :)Comparing Strandford or Berkeley, this course is a shame. Probably one of the worst CS courses at Cornell. Extremely unorganized. Professor was too busy to take care of the class. Spending a month on DFS and BFS (Remember this is a 4000level course).

I should have worried about my programming instead ... a few of the projects were tough nut( Dual SVM, trees etc.) If you put in expected work, exams are straight forward btw.Praise the department for putting a different prof in charge of 4780 next year. This was an unbearable class.GoodCrystal clear explanations, knows the material very well. You will learn in this class, although it will be difficult.One of the best professors in Cornell CS. I learned so much in CS4780. He made the course challenging and very very interesting. Can&#39;t think of any other professor who might teach this course as well as he did. I heard Thorsten wasn&#39;t too great when teaching other courses (like CS2110), but CS4780 is a must-take if he&#39;s teaching it!If Prof Thorsten is teaching machine learning, you have to take it. It&#39;s one of the toughest courses, but you feel your IQ is higher after it.Unclear and makes easy concepts unbelievably over complicated. Would not recommend.Honestly this class was a disaster, Lecture notes were terrible and most of the time was spent finding better resources to learn about every single thing he presented in class because he did such a terrible job explaining it in lecture or with lecture notes.Most enthusiastic professors I have ever seen in my life. Answers every question with patience and is very funnyThe class itself was difficult, but interesting.  There are a lot of assignments, but they have never been too long and are really fair.  What makes this class one of my favorites instead of least favorites though is definitely Kilian.  He is a great professor and an entertaining lecturer.  This is not an easy class, but it is a fun and fair one!fantastic lecturer, with just the right mix of humor and brilliance. A must take class for any CS student!!!!BAD CLASS! BAD PROF!A terrible professor who cares more about telling jokes than teaching content. If Kilian spent more time teaching than he did talking about how hard his exams were, maybe we would have learned something useful.Definitely a tough class with lots of partner projects. I won&#39;t lie and say it was easy but Kilian did a great job with the material. I really enjoyed the energy he brought to his lectures. Make sure to brush up on your linear algebra, multivariable calc, and stats before you take this class!!ML is truly as great as it is at Cornell due to the instruction of Prof. Kilian. He tries really hard to improve the class which is why it was offered at a later time and for so many students this semester. He always encourages feedback and is very organized. If you put time into the class and enjoy the material you&#39;ll do well.Just an amazing, terrific class. We were genuinely so excited to come to class every week knowing that we would be learning and laughing. It&#39;s a feat to take Machine Learning and make it digestible and exciting, but he has taken the time to develop clever and funny analogies and demos and we all really appreciated that! Very sad that it&#39;s over!I had Professor Weinberger for CS 4780 and he is the best CS professor Ive had at Cornell. His lectures are funny and the material is interesting. The only downside is the course is really challenging. Its hard to keep up unless you do the extea credit as wellgood lecturer is he a truly good professor? :(One of the best classes I have ever taken. The material is challenging but relevant and Kilian teaches in a way that is both comprehensive and captivating. I learned most of the content by reviewing the online lecture recordings (class moves pretty fast and I really benefitted from being able to pause\/rewind videos). Come ready to work and learn!Pretty awesome courseOne of my favorite courses in Cornell. Professor is very funny but teaches the material in a very clear and effective manner. Be prepared for a lot of work, but projects and homework helped with my understanding in ML. Exams are not hard as long as you spend time going through lecture notes. Definitely would love to take another class with Kilian!Ugh this class was so boring.The best class I have taken at Cornell! An excellent class to develop a strong intuition of ML. Prof Weinberger is an outstanding lecturer; the best I have had in three years at Cornell. He really cares about students understanding the content and he asks students&#39; feedback. More time on DL can make the class even better. Or a separate DL class!ML with Prof. Kilian was the worst 4000 level CS class I have taken.Prof. Weinberger is an expert on the material and covers a broad field with sufficient depth. There are growing pains to having such a large class size due to the growing popularity of the topic but I learned a lot regardless. Well prepared lecture notes and entertaining, effective demos.Professor Weinberger was an entertainer first and a lecturer second. In the end, I forgot all the material the second the final exam ended.Really bad classGreat lecturer, fair tests, and makes the subject seem interesting.Tests check how many equations you can memorize rather than a fundamental understanding of machine learning. Disorganized lectures. Tedious, buggy assignments. Useless HW assignments.He covers the core of ML with good intuition and the necessary math rigor. If you want to learn ML, this is a great starting point. As someone with previous ML exposure, I still learned useful ideas in areas I hadn&#39;t focused on much (e.g. boosting). Some reviews hype too much tho - very inaccessible prof &amp; altho clear + funny, not very engaging.","difficulty":3.025,"rating":3.3},{"index":1712,"prof_name":"Karthik Sridharan","prof_dept":"Computer Science","class_name":"CS4786","comment":"It looks like he spends little effort in preparing the lectures. He was not able to explain the course material clearly.CS 4786 is a rather theoretical class that requires you to be somewhat self-driven. The course will not spoon-feed you material. You need to be able to do some independent reading \/ review. However, most importantly, Karthik is always patient and will help you understand the material if you visit him during office hours.Subjective grading - deductions handed out whimsically in write-ups and given far more weight than the correctness of the technical work. Also, if the majority of students do well, then the professor will arbitrarily deflate all scores such that your final grade can end up being seriously hurt even if you do consistent A work throughout the course.The professor is a good guy. The problem is that he doesn&#39;t structure his class too well. He has zero exams. While this sounds great and all, this results in a lot of groups cheating on assignments and projects. Take this class only if you have a solid group, otherwise you risk getting crushed by the curve.A good teacherHomework is utterly irrelevant the the lectures. Lectures are dry.I strongly disliked this professor and this class. Up until the last 2.5 weeks of class things were not that bad. Lectures were dry (most people did not show up), professor often made mistakes in lecture, and he was unclear. Fortunately, hw was easy up until this point. Then in the last 2 weeks everything went to hell and things became impossible.Lillian is one of the best teachers I have had the privilege to be taught by ever. To start with, she &#39;s so freaking cute and adorable and  so so smart in a dorky way,she&#39;d explain things in a way that she would not only uncomplicate stuff but also make concepts really fun and interesting.  I would never miss any of Lillian&#39;s lectures.The worst Professor I&#39;ve ever had in my life. AVOID.This was by far the worst class I have taken at Cornell. Karthik is a very nice guy but my god are his lectures dull. 75% of the class doesn&#39;t show to lecture and the ones that do are put to sleep by his droning. Assignments are more or less not correlated with the material taught, and the TAs are the least caring bunch I&#39;ve ever seen.

Lectures can be slow, but are very intuitive. #3 on problem sets can be very difficult sometimes. Exams are pretty easy. Advice: start psets the day they get released and rEAD the TEXTBOOK!Amazing professor. Sometimes we would get distracted from what we are supposed to do, but overall, a great professor.He is extremely intelligent and very committed in helping his students learn the material. He can be a little brash when dealing with administrative issues in the course, but seems genuinely interested in his teaching duties. Would highly recommend taking 4820 under him if you want to seriously test your understanding of algorithms.Professor R. Kleinberg was excellent for Algorithms, Spring 2014. He is very open to student questions and attempts to make a sometimes-challenging subject clear. Not an easy professor by any means, but assessments fair. Relies on the textbook a good amount, but also references outside research.R. Kleinberg is an amazing teacher and super smart. His lectures are organized, exciting and the material is super fun and challenging. The HWs are super super challenging. Every HW has a question which is so  hard that sometimes the TAs arent sure on how to solve them. But it is fun to solve the HWS. I really improved my problem solving skills.Had him for both 4820 and 6820. Great lecturer (he writes a lot, so it is hard sometimes to keep up with both listening and writing down nots). Amazing personality (will go overtime to answer your question). In OH, he will insightfully lead you to think rather than just giving answer away. HW can be super challenging.He basically gives the answers to students he likes and students who have no shame when asking directly for the answers to problem sets. He is also not useful in lecture. The textbook was the only way someone could learn in that class. He just tried to show off and act cool during lecture.Clear lecturer who cares about students&#39; understanding of the material. Will answer many Piazza posts personally, and made reasonable adjustments to the course due to its virtual format.His lecturing style as well as his mastery of the subject matter are both top-notch. He also seems like a great person. It&#39;s an absolute privilege to have him as a lecturer.Amazing professor. Had him for algorithms. Very nice guy and very helpful. Prelims and homeworks are fair, and the homework load is very manageable. Was easier in 2013 than before.I love Kozen. I had him for algorithms. Normally this course is done by Kleinberg. His lectures were on videonote, but in my opinion Kozen&#39;s were twice as good. I think Kozen is clear, interesting, and one of the most helpful professors I ever had. You never feel lost by him, or confused. My favorite CS professor by a long shot. Fair tests and HW.The assignments were hard at times but not unreasonably so. The textbook was written by Tardos (and others) specifically for this course, and the explanations are outstanding.

As long as you fill out the practice questions for the prelim ahead of time you should do well in this class.Very interesting class. Dr. Evans is accessible and truly cares about his students. Grading is very fair, but not an &#34;easy A&#34; class. You have to work on things thoroughly and ahead of time to make sure you get all the points. Some people don&#39;t do this and underestimate the workload. Then they get points off and think the grading is harsh.Professor Evans is very helpful and clear in lectures. His lectures are engaging and usually interesting. His tests are not too bad but sometimes his TAs grade a bit harshly. Professor Evans is very helpful in his office hours and very fair. He has done a lot of famous research and written several books but he is very humble in class. Professor Evans is a fantastic lecturer and you can tell he really cares about his students. Highly recommend!Don&#39;t expect to be able to ask your TAs about making anything clearer before tests or projects; they aren&#39;t responsible for grading, and some (if not all) of them don&#39;t even go to class. Gary Evans is a fine lecturer (if he would just put some words in his slideshows instead of just pictures every now and again), but the class is disorganized.I can&#39;t rave about Gary enough. He is extremely caring and accommodating to students. He has no problems with giving extensions. The class itself is pretty easy. If you went to lecture and took good notes, exams should be a breeze, but still pretty time-consuming. Assigned readings aren&#39;t necessary to get an A. The class material is also very cool.Professor Evans is amazing! His slides are easy to understand and he makes them so applicable to our lives! The class is interdisciplinary and very interesting, and his method of preparing students for exams is really effective and shows that he cares. Definitely recommend!Absolutely a great class. Makes you think beyond simple principles and forces you to apply your understanding to real world, environmental examples. Prof. gives ten essay questions before the test, and the tests consists of four of the ten, randomly given. Very very fair, and the class makes sure that you understand the material. Tons of extracredtThis is an interesting, low-stress course that gives you a language to think about the environment in. Gary is helpful, exams are fair, and projects are relaxed. The one frustration was that many studies seemed vague or even outdated. We needed to think about fewer studies in more depth rather than brush over sketchy data.Took this class not knowing anything prior about the subject to for credit requirement. Lectures were really interesting. Pay attention during them because slides won&#39;t really help much and office hours before prelims are packed. love his prelim system, and the extra credit helps a lot. Dont be afraid to approach him before class!! fun guyProfessor Evans is a great lecturer - I took this for a distribution requirement and loved it. Just make sure you go to lecture and take good notes, he encourages to use group effort to prepare for all exams and all answers to 10 essay questions are covered in lecture. No need for any readings, so don&#39;t buy them! Just go to class, and listen:)Gary is an amazing professor and his teaching style has really contributed to making my life simpler. You have to go to lecture or make sure you know someone who takes good notes because his slides are hard to understand if he doesn&#39;t explain them. His grading system is fair and office hours are a very beneficial. Also make sure to ask questions.I took an economics class with the allegedly distinguished professor Evans. When I had received a puzzling low mark on an assignment, I had asked him for Office Hours, where he repeatedly made clear he only takes students alone. When I had arrived, he seemed very distracted and was constantly jingling change in his pocket. Unprofessional boomerEvans is such a nice guy. Go to lecture, pay attention, and you will breeze by with an A. Distributes ample exam questions well before tests - answer them thoroughly, because he picks 4-5 of them of the 8-10 given to place on the exam. Don&#39;t buy readings, just take notes in class. Tests feel long, but if you answered the ?s beforehand it&#39;s easy.Gary Evans is a wonderful professor. He really loves teaching and is very willing to talk to outside of class. The tests, however, are a series of incredibly specific questions that are given out a few weeks before the test. Prof. Evans does hours of prelim review, which is essential for doing well because in grading he looks for specific answers.I really enjoyed the lectures, but the exams were extremely intense and graded toughly (despite questions being released ahead of time). The TAs are tough graders too when it comes to the projects. This would have been one of my favorite classes if the exams were not as excessive\/detailed. The professor is really insightful.This class is great for anyone interested in design, human behavior, or a little self-reflection. TAs grade prelims kind of harshly, but you can easily make up for it with the projects and attendance grade. DO THE EXTRA CREDIT; it will help a lot. Overall, good lecturer, VERY interesting class.Very straightforward and easy class. Lots of opportunity for extra credit (with SONA), and the rubric is very clear. Going to lecture is pretty important as his slides\/slide summaries aren&#39;t very informative on their own. He&#39;s a very engaging and good lecturer though, and it&#39;s very clear he knows what he&#39;s talking about.The only redeeming aspect of this course is that attendance is not required.  Gary Evans is a nice human being, but shockingly stupid.  Class is rampant with overgeneralizations, confusion of correlation and causation, and old, weak data.  If you wish to become a more critically thinking person, do not take this course.Class is very interesting for anyone. Assignments aren&#39;t hard. Tests are doable, but sometimes the TAs grade too harshly. After one exam, I got a pretty low grade and asked the TAs why I lost certain points. They couldn&#39;t explain some to me, so I went to Evans and he offered to meet with me for 2 hours going over each little point. Recommended.Talks about things that really make sense and can be applied to everyday life but are still unique and insightful. Great for anyone interested in design, and for anyone just interested in how people of different cultures and in different settings interact with their environments.Gary is a great lecturer, very insightful and fun to just sit back and listen to. You can do pretty well without doing the reading, but the readings are actually pretty interesting and you end up getting a LOT more out of his lectures if you&#39;ve done the readings beforehand. Also he&#39;s very approachable and great to talk to.Professor Evans is a clear lecturer, is interesting, and is very helpful in his office hours (especially in that he has many many office hours near prelim times).  The tests are short essays, but you are given a bank of essay questions (4\/10 questions chosen) before hand, which is nice :).Tests are very lengthy and may be only 4 short essay questions, but each question has an 1a, 1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f, etc, so really it&#39;s like answering 30 q&#39;s. Wish I were kidding. you really have to prepare, &amp; even then it doesn&#39;t guarantee you&#39;ll do well. Take the WIM section. it reduces the test grades to only 25% of your grade.

Sweet professor. No studying necessary.Easy class!! I had a great TA who made the class worthwhile. However, the professor is a horrible lecturer. He is extremely biased and does not paint an accurate picture of both points of view. Basically the whole class is set up to convince you of his point of view on every issue. However, if you want an easy A you can easily get one in this classThis guy HATES Protestants.  He just talks about things he has NO idea about.  Often, students will correct him.  HE doesn&#39;t know what Gallileo did OR what his thoughts were.  He also has an extreme obsession with his bike and HATES cars.  The class is pretty freaking easy so like take it though....The class is easy, and Hirschl goes into the readings with a good amount of depth. The only thing is, the guy can come off as a complete idiot. He pulls examples from history and science without doing the proper research and doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s talking about. He&#39;s also a communist which I find entertaining.he twists the students&#39; comments so they&#39;ll fit his thoughts, all he ever talks about is how cars are ruining the world, and he is ABSOLUTELY NOT objective... keep that in mind... you don&#39;t need to do the reading cuz he&#39;ll explain them well in the class and is pretty clear, but his personal thoughts get in the way of teachingeasy but a little boring - not incredibly enthusiatic or personableThe stereotypical crazy college professor. This is the reason they&#39;re called &#34;professors&#34; - he just stands up there and professes about why cars are evil, why black people are sociologically inferior, and why religion is a waste of time. But I studied for about 30 seconds for the prelim and got a 91, so I&#39;m not complaining!Really easy class and the topics are interesting, but he presents it in a way that doesn&#39;t really hold your interest. Don&#39;t really need to go to class to do well.If you are a legitimate student, this will be cake.  It&#39;s so easy!  But I hated myself for taking it.  He is biased, and the worst thing was that the pre-med\/science types couldn&#39;t even see through his garbage enough to be outraged.  Unless you need a GPA boost badly, don&#39;t take this class- it was the worst one i&#39;ve taken since middle school.Not too difficult, interesting topicsThis guy is amazing, but if you become his friend, his class will become even more amazing and he will fascinate you to no end.  He is a great person who knows a lot and is willing to share, but only if he likes you and you get to know him.  So get to know him, and it will be a great experience.  Class was pretty easy; not about the grade with him.I am an Applied Engineering Physics major and I had a 4.0  until I took Dsoc.I had to pull all-nighters every other day to keep up with the work.This class ruined my GPA,but more importantly, my life.The triple integrals he puts on the exam are ridiculously hard to solve.Bring a graphing calculator to the exams,and some extra batteries just in case","difficulty":1.5833333333,"rating":3.5},{"index":1796,"prof_name":"Marygold Walsh-Dilley","prof_dept":"Sociology","class_name":"DSOC110","comment":"she&#39;s really wants you to learn the soc concepts.

Definitely had to put work into it. I recommend doing the readings, then you don&#39;t have to come to class. The TAs were super helpful, otherwise, I went to each and every class, and just spent my time on the internet, because it&#39;s extremely hard to focus, and I don&#39;t know why. Readings=interesting. Prof=not.Pretty chill and easy class. Grading is done by TAs so it can be pretty hit\/miss. Lectures are unnecessary, just show up the day there&#39;s a quiz. Discussion is mandatory but it&#39;s pretty chill and mostly opinion based. Reading summaries are due every week, and there are three essays. It&#39;s a lot of work but it&#39;s well structured and a pretty easy A.Great professor, had him for DSOC 1101. Go to lecture once a week when the weekly quizzes are, if no quiz don&#39;t bother going to lecture. The class was not bad and I learned a lot!I&#39;ll try to be objective and critical, something that this professor is not. The most BS class I&#39;ve ever taken. His lectures are tangental, without evidence and leaves you thinking that only 85% of what he said is true. His exam questions are his interpretations of the readings, not the author&#39;s actual points. Any answer could be correct.This is the worst class I&#39;ve ever taken at Cornell. Hirschl  hates economics as a science(and consequently economics majors like myself) and is the most boring lecturer ever. Even the books he chose were biased. (Perrucci and Wysong thought D.A.R.E was a conspiracy to distract the masses from social inequality) I got an A+ but didn&#39;t learn much.Prof Hirschl is awful. DSOC 1101 is awful. If you do the work, you will get a good grade, but the amount of work is obscene for such a stupid class. Hirschl tests you on his own material and his own views. I didnt know what sociology was until I looked it up three weeks into class. He makes you buy books for two chapters. AVOID if you enjoy sanit yI actually learned a lot about things of social importance in this class and it opened my eyes to the world after taking only science classes prior to it. I hardly went to lecture, but the material was interesting and it was an easy A. In section we had one paper that wasn&#39;t even graded. Exams were somewhat tough but curved highTake it for the diversity credit and just get out with an A.I remember that in the first lecture Prof. Hirschl was making his powerpoint slides in class. Yes, in class, while he was lecturing. His lectures were so random. He started off talking about the reading, made a few completely unrelated points, and he started criticizing some other sociologist, and then another sociologist, and then another. Professor Parfait really cares about the subject matter and his class stays interesting. I really enjoyed this class because it actually applies to our everyday lives. Not difficult, just have to read textbook for homework assignments.This class was useless but I took it for the easy A. Literally rarely came to class but came to all of the sections and did the readings. Take it for the diversity distribution requirement. You won&#39;t regret it.he&#39;s a terrible lecturer, goes on tangents so often. he also sometimes confuses himself; sitting in class I hear a lot of snickering from the classmates when he says something that doesn&#39;t make sense (which is a lot). my TA is respectful but even he knew that the lecturers didn&#39;t help much. MC tests are vague; prelim averages were 80-82%.Actually the worst professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell -- I don&#39;t care if he is a brilliant researcher. He had no investment in the class, terrible lectures and had no care whatsoever what students took away from his class - truly terrible.If you want to be constantly indoctrinated with socialst ideas, take this course.  Hirschl legitimately spends most of his time in lecture pushing an agenda.  It&#39;s infuriating when the garbage he&#39;s spewing is coming out of the mouth of a bumbling idiot.  That said, this class is an absolute joke and if you have a functioning brain it&#39;s an easy A.Hirschl was an okay professor. Your success in the class really depends on the quality of your TA. If you have a bad TA who doesn&#39;t hand back assignments and doesn&#39;t cover all of the required material for the week because s\/he runs out of time, then your grades will likely suffer. There are weekly assignments but the workload isn&#39;t too bad.First two readings were hard, rest was pretty easy.  Actually pretty interesting.These other ratings are bogus. This was one of the best classes I took at Cornell. Didn&#39;t learn too much, busy easy A, engaging lecture, and he&#39;s such a really nice guy. 2 prelims, final, section attendance, and discussion is all. Would def take again.Hirschl&#39;s lectures are scattered, and his explanations of concepts are very vague. I did not know what &#34;developmental sociology&#34; was until our TA explained it halfway through the semester. He uses examples that are not thought out, and you could argue that all choices on his multiple choice questions are correct. Even so, the class is super easy. His lectures are very disorganized, but you learn a lot from the readings alone that it&#39;s fine that the lectures are a bit messy. The discussion sections are the most beneficial time where you really learn the concepts. Overall a really good class that is easily doable and you actually learn a lot if you do the readings and attend section.If you try, you&#39;ll get a good grade.  Hirschl hates economics and spends most of the time explaining his own views and supporting himself with questionable evidence.  Whenever he uses scientific evidence as support, he looks foolish to the science majors.  All correct answers on exams are variations of: &#34;Whites &amp; men are oppressing blacks &amp; women.&#34;One mid term and a final. If you go to lecture and understand basic ideas, the tests aren&#39;t too difficult. Go to lecture to get extra credit from iclickers. One group presentation in discussion section and weekly readings that you have to write on. Do the readings, they are on the test.He is a kind professor, the grades mainly depend on the TAs though so try to find out which ones are good. The professor is a good lecturer and seems to care about students. At the end of one of the lectures (not the last lecture), everyone clapped because he was so inspirational. The tests are open note so they weren&#39;t too difficult.An extremely intelligent man, but not a very good professor for introductory classes. Very disorganized but still managed to teach so that material stuck the first time hearing it. Attend discussionit helps. Go to office hours or email for help on essays and group projects.This class is way too much for 3 credits, from 30 minute student presentations to very vague and unclear essay assignments with changing and unclear due dates. The lectures are unsimulating and I felt like I am not learning anything at all.

He also tries to be provocative and ends up being really rude to students. Wouldnt take again.Agree with prior comments, professor grades you on saying what he says in class and his books, this subject matter should be flexible and subjective and you should have your own opinion but you are penalized for that.

Overall, it was a low-effort class except for the group project, which was pretty time-consuming.Cannot follow his lecture. Cumbersome group project. Tough biweekly quizzes. Annoying diary entries. Avoid at all costProfessor Brown is an intelligent and humorous teacher who cares about his students. Though EAS1220 is known as an &#34;easy science&#34; because he teaches by repetition and offers up a lot of &#39;gimme&#39; points, his lectures are quite complex\/VERY hard to follow and a lot of memorization is required if you&#39;re after an A.I enjoyed going to his lectures. The class is huge so I recommend sitting near the front so you don&#39;t miss what he says. It&#39;ll help you out during the quizzes. For homework, all you have to do is read chapters from an online textbook and answer questions at the end. Fairly easy. Study the powerpoints for the prelim and final and you should do well.Professor Brown is by far the most considerate teacher I&#39;ve had. He offers make up quizzes and keeps postponing  deadlines for assignments. Though his lectures can be quite confusing you&#39;ll find it easy if you actually read the textbook.if you are into subtle humor and if you find non-funny things hilarious, you will love this professor as a person. but he speaks way too fast and has trouble communicating a lot of concepts. If you manage to pay attention despite all the loud people in class, memorize the lectures, and memorize key terms you should get an A.You have to put in work to get an A. I found the homework assignments long and tedious and the tests\/quizzes are based solely on lectures. If you don&#39;t attend lecture, you probably won&#39;t do well on the exams because the slides alone aren&#39;t helpful. He is also very unorganized when he lectures so its hard to stay focused and grasp concepts.Pay attention during his boring lectures and focus on vocab --- fairly easy A but don&#39;t underestimate it. Most kids do poorly because they think it&#39;ll be a &#34;show up and pass&#34; but slight effort really seals the &#34;A&#34;.  The in-class quizzes are pretty tough and he pulls most of them for exam questions.Great guy, wants you to succeed. If you don&#39;t do well on the prelim or final, the group project (basically a second prelim) will give a tremendous boost to your grade (it&#39;s worth 20%+ of the class). If you read the textbook and listen in class you&#39;ll do fine. I didn&#39;t really do any work and managed a B+.Extremely disorganized in his lecture style and in his grading. Lectures to an incredible level of detail, then tests on that detail. DO NOT take this thinking it is an easy class to fulfill the science requirement. Still wishing I had dropped this class while I could.This class was easy in part because I ordered the take note service and studied from those for the midterm and the final.  I would recommend getting those, without them the class would have been significantly more difficult because Professor Brown can be really hard to follow, and the class can get super boring and mundane.Funny professor... because of takenote did not go to lectures.. did decent. quizzes are same as last years, and the midterm was identical. FInal was hard.This class was incredibly disorganized. Lectures never started on time, material was unclear, group projects were described very vaguely.

He wants everyone to do well, and if you study, you can easily get an A. He is the kindest, funniest, greatest professor out there. No other professor can make such a large class so interesting. Everyone loves him.This guy is a great professor and extremely passionate about oceanography, but the class isn&#39;t really a gut anymore. Definitely study for exams because he recycles less than half the questions now and topics mentioned in lecture will be specifically asked. Take this class because it&#39;s a classic, but also take it seriously. Bruce is incredibly passionate about his field. He really just wants you to develop somewhat of a passion for the ocean; he&#39;s not looking to make the course hard. Pre-lims are actually difficult if you don&#39;t study. I didn&#39;t attend lecture regularly, because the lectures are recorded and posted online, and I really regret it. Go to lecture. I got 5 past exams (coursehero) - gave my iclicker to a friend - ended up with A+. Don&#39;t you think there&#39;s something wrong?

Paired with the many typos in his slides make for a frustrated lecture. &#34;Cold tong&#34;Bruce should be running this university.Prof Monger will change your life. He really cares about his students and making sure they learn instead of regurgitating info for a test. The lecture slides highlight exam material and a night of rewatching lectures will secure an A. Don&#39;t worry about your grade, seriously. Take this class if you want to be inspired to change the world.Bruce is the man. Fun and easy to follow classes and tests, he even worked with me to let me take a midterm early so I could entertain family that flew in.Excellent lecturer that cares very deeply for environmental and oceanographic issues. Teaches you exactly what you need to know for quizzes\/exams (and even highlights &#34;exam-content&#34; on his lecture slides). Stay on top of small-weekly assignments and do a thorough review before exams, and you&#39;ll get an good grade.Not only is this class easy, but it is amazing. Bruce is so inspiring and delivers the content really well (designed for everyone, not just science kids). I want to spend the rest of my professional career working in sustainability because of this class. Everyone should take this class before they graduate.Bruce is an interesting and amusing man. At times, he can be repetitive (either when it&#39;s a tough concept or an idea that he deems &#34;super important&#34;). He&#39;s very, caring and laid-back. If you take advantage of the study materials he provides the tests are very fair. This unexpectedly turned out to be one of the most inspiring class I&#39;ve ever taken.NOTE: 1560 has become more difficult compared to previous terms (as compared to comments by student who took it before). The course still holds very high value in oceanography, climate change and natural science knowledge for both major and non-majors. Bruce&#39;s stance and passion have not changed. Still amazing lectures. Beware of lab component.Very fair, very clear, very enthusiastic.love bruce!! didnt really think about the ocean much now all of a sudden i want to be an environmentalist lol. this class really is an easy A (disregard my grade) and even despite things being online and different he makes the lectures fun and easy, and even the longer lectures arent hard to follow. the assignments are easy and personalOne generously-graded essay was the only homework assignment of the year. Attendance is not necessary if you&#39;re not interested in the material, although you&#39;ll have to study a bit more for the exams.Oceanography and Bruce truly changed me as a person and my entire perspective. The class is super easy, but the real takeaway is becoming more aware and active the current crises of climate change our planet is facing. Bruce is hilarious and this class is a must take for anyone at Cornell, can not recommend enough!!!Lectures are super inspiring and the class material isn&#39;t too difficult. All prelims are multiple choice and were difficult for me at least since the material was so cursory it was difficult to gauge what would appear on exams and some questions felt somewhat trivial.genuinely inspiring guy who made me care a lot more about the environment. tests are not particularly difficult but can get very trivial. great class for science requirement. bruce really designs his class to help students out a lot.I highly recommend taking Oceanography to anyone looking for an interesting and inspirational class (that is easy with minimal work!) Many of the lectures left me with a changed perspective of the world. Lectures are not mandatory(notes are posted)but I recommend attending to get the most out of the class! The only &#34;HW&#34; was a short weekly question.Oceanography is an interesting topic, but the class wouldn&#39;t have been nearly as interesting if it was taught by someone else. Prof. Monger is passionate about climate change and wants people to make an impact outside of class. Class is definitely not mandatory but Prof. Monger gives such good lectures that it&#39;s worth it to go.An amazing professor! Inspirational and easy A. Attending lecture is necessary but the lectures are recorded. If you want to be inspired as well as know more about the ocean, take his class.Literally the best teacher ever. He is so passionate about oceanography and so caring about his students. His interest in the subject and the fact that he is such a nice person makes your day so much better.Hands down best professor I&#39;ve ever had at Cornell. He genuinely wants you to do well. His class is truly inspirational, and he does an amazing job at teaching and informing you about current issues and makes you want to be a proactive person. Class was very enriching. Definitely take it.He got preachy in the second half, but, if you can stomach that, really easy way to boost GPA and fulfill distribution requirement.Bruce is legendary.Bruce is the BEST. He is so passionate about what he teaches and truly inspires his students. Show up to his class- he really appreciates seeing students engaged in his class. He changed my view completely about climate change and the ocean in general. He is one of the best professors I&#39;ve had at Cornell. TAKE HIS CLASS!! you will not regret it.Bruce Monger is an exceptional professor. He is truly inspirational. Put in a little bit of work and you will get an A!One of the best professors Ive ever had at Cornell. Beyond the material, his grading criteria is super clear, he posts lecture videos online, and he literally highlights what you should know for exams in red. Watch the videos and take notes at 2x speed, youll be set. Not to mention he is phenomenal at inspiring you re: climate changeI did not really enjoy this lecture. I&#39;m not a science person in general, so I was not really looking forward to this class. People call this class an easy A, but it is a lot of memorizing. I&#39;m not good at memorizing, so I did not do as well as I had hoped. However, it is pretty easy for a science class, and you get extra credit for attendance.Awesome Professor. Nice guy and overall cares a lot for the oceans. Would take the class again if I could.Prof. Monger&#39;s class was the best. Attendance is not mandatory, but you should always show up for your own good! At first, the class felt super technical and somewhat of a drag. Looking back, however, I&#39;m so thankful for how much I&#39;ve learned in regard to climate change. Very inspiring, and overall super rewarding as a &#34;life lessons&#34; class.Best professor I&#39;ve had at CornellThis class is worth the hype. Passionate professor who really cares about the subject. Exams are straight forward. Weekly assignments are easy and helps you gain perspective on what is going on in the world climate wise. Best class I&#39;ve taken at Cornell.some strong parts, some poor. really wants to be the students friend for some reason.I took this class because I heard it was easy, but I got so much more out of it than that. Monger is actually such an inspirational guy and whether you like it or not you&#39;ll walk out of there with a MUCH deeper appreciation for the environment. He cares more about students learning than grades. More professors should be like Bruce, he&#39;s the best!Bruce is the man. He genuinely cares about the environment and student learning. The class isn&#39;t difficult but you do need to put in some effort for the exams since it does require a good amount of memorization. He really cares about environmental activism and about his students actually learning rather than just grades.Compelling lectures. Can sometimes get opinionated but it doesn&#39;t get in the way of course content. Passionate about subject manner, makes it very easy to understand.","difficulty":1.7209302326,"rating":4.6511627907},{"index":1848,"prof_name":"Mark Wysocki","prof_dept":"Science","class_name":"EAS1600","comment":"For those with a strong science background who are not meteorology majors: His lectures are aggressive and condescending.

Awful class.A very easy course that liberal arts majors terrified of hard sciences go to for a requirement.

Take it if the topic interests you, otherwise you will zone out. A free A\/A+ for engineers\/scientistsPlease do not take any of his classes. He should not be teaching because he is not capable of putting together a lecture that makes any sense. He might grade easy at the end but this class is a nightmare. You will not know what is going, regardless if you read the textbook. He seems like a nice person but he can&#39;t teach to save his life. The worst lecturer I have ever had.

If you could learn 10% of what he knows, you would be an expert!Great guy; very good friends with him too. he always went the extra mile to help youGreat professor. Try&#39;s to be funny and makes stupid jokes but you gotta love him anyway.  Good to talk to, very extroverted. Recommended professor.I&#39;m a Belina convert. Here&#39;s the guy who made me want to stick to ECE (after I switched from AEP). Best Professor I&#39;ve encountered so far in Engineering. Lectures are interesting and clear. This class is not too hard - study and you&#39;ll do well. Belina really loves to help his students, and he&#39;ll answer any questions you might have.Unprepared for lecture.  Every lecture, EVERY lecture, makes numerous algebraic mistakes and students in lecture correct him.  Ability to teach verging on ridiculous.  Require class, but if possible, AVOID AT ALL COSTS.This guy is the man. One of the best professors I&#39;ve ever had. He is friendly, nice and super helpful. His voice is clear and calm, making it easy to understand his lectures. Very approachable and is always looking to help his students to better in the class. I hope I have him for a future ECE class.Belina teaching has some major flaws. He tries to be helpful but never lets people even finish their questions.  Goes off on tangents.  Tries to be funny but is not in the least.You are blessed by Cornell if you have this teacher.  I&#39;ve never had a better prof. yet!  His willingness to engage with students and be helpful is unprecidented.  He really enjoys what he does.No CommentsNice guy. Pretty good at teaching.Can&#39;t do basic math for the life of him and screws up all the time on the blackboard, but if you can follow along with what he&#39;s trying to do, he rocks. Very funny guy, and helpful.","difficulty":2.9210526316,"rating":4.0},{"index":1891,"prof_name":"Alyosha Molnar","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"ECE2100","comment":"A nice and interesting guy. Seems to care about his students and is willing to help them when they ask for help. Lectures are very good, but problem sets are difficult.Pollock was very clear and lucid, though he did make a few math errors that made you lose concentration. The class is sooooo much work but he knows this and gives us straightforward prelims and homeworks.Expect lots of work and a lot of learning! Go to office hours and become friends with him! He puts in a lot of effort.talks extremely fast, ridiculously long and hard problem sets2100 was terrible with Prof. Tong. I didn&#39;t understand why he taught subjects in the order he did confusing. He was awful at lecturing and condescending towards undergraduate students. He had a very poor grasp of what sophomore-level ECEs should already know or what they haven&#39;t learned it. I could barely sit through each lecture. Super hard but worth itAmazing lectures, lots of problem sets and labs, but ultimately worth it. He and the TAs put a lot of time into the course to ensure a full understanding of analog circuits. Also really interesting uy to talk to outside of class.Despite the overwhelming amount of work we were assigned, most of it was not worth much. It was a very leniently graded class and the professors and TAs spent well more than the required amount of time to ensure a high level of understanding.This class kinda stinks...Belina is an amazing person but not that great of a teacher. He simplifies everything FAR too much. Normally, that&#39;s a good thing but I don&#39;t even learn anything in detail from going to class. Classes are basically a summary of what&#39;s in the book, but watered down. Plus the book sucks. Belina is an awesome guy though.Prof. Molnar&#39;s 2100 will consume your life with coursework if you let it. Overall, it was very educational and worthwhile. And he&#39;s a really nice guy. Many students suspect he has (not so) secret superhuman ECE powers.Honestly a great professor. Teaches the Intro Circuits class very well, doesn&#39;t waste time during lectures. Can tell he really cares about ensuring that you&#39;re getting your money&#39;s worth from the lectures, so they end up being quite dense and fast paced. Has hilarious comments he&#39;ll make during class. 2100 is hard b\/c of material, not b\/c of him.Lecture&#39;s are pretty standard, a bit fast paced at first, but settles down as the semester progresses. Problem sets are biweekly, but very long. Labs also take a very long time and are often confusing. Exams are very easy; he gives you very explicit hints to the content of the exams before hand since 2100 covers so much material.He&#39;s a nice guy and is always willing to help you out. That said, lectures are hopelessly fast paced, he treats corequisites as prerequisites, and blows through a 2-3 semester texbook in one.An extremely challenging professor. Lectures left me lost and confused every time with difficult exams. Homework and lab reports took forever. Some labs were interesting, but the class was a nightmare overall.Professor Molnar is a fantastic guy. He&#39;s an absolute genius, super nice, and always willing to help his students. You will learn so much if you take ECE 2100 and try your hardest to understand the material being thrown at you. That being said, do not expect this class to be a breeze. Homework sets take forever and labs are tedious. Come prepared.Prof. Molnar is many things, easy is not one of them. His problem sets\/labs are positively sadistic, but he holds himself to the same high standards he holds you to. He is incredibly dedicated (teaches his own discussions, writes own labs) and is super-helpful when you talk to him in person. Overall, a great guy\/teacher who will teach you  a ton.Shealy is ridiculously smart. Definitely a genius.One of the best professors I&#39;ve ever had. He really cares about his students\/teaching, is very understanding, and is always willing to help. However, this was also the hardest class I have taken (prelims were pretty rough, labs and homework sets were long\/difficult). This class will teach you to care more about learning than your gradeReally good at showing you how to solve problems step by step.  He uses more difficult examples and it really helps on the homework.  The problem sets he assigns are a bit tedious but in the end you do end up learning a lot.  This class is part of the reason I decided to switch majors!Shealy is the MAN. He teaches you how to think like an engineer. His tests are a bit tough but if you have the intuition they&#39;re easy. I just wish he&#39;d teach every ECE class because that would be sickThe absolute best professor I&#39;ve had. Look at the recent article in the Engineering magazine about how far out of his way he goes to help students. Shows to ALL labs and sections. He is always in a good mood and ready to help without question. A genuinely passionate professor.He was the best professor I had in my 5 yrs in Cornell, and my mentor. I even had the honor to help him grade one of his classes and edit one of his books (NOT because I was the smartest, but because I worked the hardest). When did Cornellians become lazy? Dr. Kelley, YOU are the BEST. Your student from &#39;84-85 days.. Diana U.~~One of the lowest grades I received in an ECE course at Cornell yet I felt like I learned so much more in this class then any other. Professor Molnar is truly a genius. His homecooked homework problems are very difficult, and the labs are harshly grades, but if you apply yourself through and don&#39;t worry about your grade here you will learn so much.Awesome guy, always willing to help out and clearly knows his stuff, but is pretty bad at explaining things to students clearly. Class was a bit of a meme as nobody knew what was going on 90% of the time, but it was a fun course to be inChallenging but very dedicated to his course.  Excellent selection of TAs.  Attends every discussion and some labs to help out.One of the best professors. Cares a lot of his students and is aware of their work load. He is always willing to help and is very clear in explanations.Lectures weren&#39;t very stimulating. Basically followed the book word-for-word. Homework assignments and lab reports were a pain. As long as you study the material, the prelims aren&#39;t difficult.Prof. Pollock is undoubtedly the best lecturer I have had at Cornell so far. He made a hard subject really easy to understand. He is very enthusiastic about ECE, which is infectious and makes you want to pay attention in class. He is also always ready to answer questions on the material and is very approachable.Awesome professor. Really cares about his students. Expects a lot but is very conscious of the workload his students are dealing with. Always willing to help. Lectures are clearer than any others. Best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell.

HWs were Q&#39;s off the text, though I wish he put his own questions. Exams were unstable in difficulty. He&#39;s not bad though and he&#39;s funny sometimes. He means well too, because he wants to consider our feedback on the course to hopefully run it in a more stable manner. This was his first time teaching 2200 I think.Negative stigma about him is over hyped. I&#39;ve had many professors who were harder to follow along during lecture. He really does care about students and wants everyone to succeed. He is also hilarious. However, the course&#39;s administration is disorganized. He gives extra help sessions every week. He drops one prelim grade.His class is very dull and the test averages can range anywhere from 55 to 85. The labs are extremely time consuming and are not worth that much. I wouldn&#39;t take it again unless it was required.Professor Doerschuk was... interesting. He&#39;s a really nice guy and seemed like he really wanted to help his students, answering any questions. Had review sessions before each exam and the night before each pset was due. He just was bad in lecture, where material was confusing, he went out of order from book. Final grades were lower than expectedThis is definitely my worst teacher ever at Cornell. Makes such an easy course unnecessarily hard, assumes a lot when he explains, doesn&#39;t have a syllabus, jumps back and forth in the textbook, gives a lot of exam matching questions not related to the lecture and I can continue ranting on and on. But take signals with this man at your ow risk.Lectures do not relate homework at the time it is due.  Definitely not an exciting class.  Held early in the morning with over half of people either absent or asleep.  Lots of Matlab use.  Helpful at strengthening programming and math skills.HILARIOUSI learned the whole course on my own unfortunately.This mans is chaotic good. Super unorganized and sort of just unaware of what goes on outside his world, eg university policies and such, but really just trying to do good by his students. He&#39;s really explicit about what kinds of problems will be on exams, so just gotta know those and you&#39;re fine!Lectures are confusing, he kept writing every single word he said on the board. Few people can catch up with his notes. Once you lost track of what&#39;s going on, the rest of the lecture becomes a waste of time. TAs are not quite helpful.Very easy professor to learn from. He clearly writes down all the concepts during lectures as well as gives you very helpful hints for exam problems. Always has a review session before homework due dates and exams. Plus, he&#39;s really funny and likes to have fun while teaching.Super funny lectures and pretty clear lectures, but there is a good amount of disorganization. Disorganization doesn&#39;t detract from the course too much.  Fair exams, with very specific hints to content on them. Really got me interested in signals in the first place.Not quite sure what class the previous student went to because his class is extremely disorganized. Piazza questions mainly left unanswered. The 3rd prelim was not graded till a week after the final. No regrades for either exam but they were &#34;available for pickup in his office&#34; days after the last day of finals when most students had already left.Knows his stuff, but not good at conveying it. Lectures move very quickly and he&#39;s not clear in his lectures. Assumes prior comfort with math. Lectures were harder than the prelims. Labs were worthwhile -- they helped visualize the material in Matlab.Snitch, always out there to hurt and back-stab his own students. Do not trust him with any questions he asks or responds to, and always-always record him. He ruined multiple students life and career for his personal interests. Don&#39;t take his classes, and if you are wronged by all means then file a complaint against him.Super funny during lecture. Lectures are disorganized but the textbook and his typed notes make it pretty clear. He always gives out what will be on the exam so study those HW problems specifically or you&#39;ll fail. He also gives answers to the hw at the help sessions so go to them. Although I loved doerschuk, I don&#39;t think I learned much.Such a good lecturer. He is so smart, it&#39;s a bit hard to follow his thought process fast enough in person. But he always records his lectures and posts them online. When you watch his lecture for a second time online, it is so mind-opening and it makes everything so explainable! Definitely gonna take his class 3250 next sem!Worst ECE professor here at Cornell. Tests are INCREDIBLY unfair. He is not one bit helpful at all, and extremely unpleasant to talk to. Avoid classes with this professor at all costs.The worst professor I have encountered in two years. His mastery of powerful (and interesting!) topics is overshadowed by mediocre lectures, unfair tests, and assignments worthy of no more than a kindergarten classroom. Sadly, he killed our interest in the material.Miserable professor. Assignments have little to no relevance to what is on an exam, and take way too long to complete. The exams are not comprehensive, and do not reward students who study or have a deep knowledge of the material.Class made mandatory by pop quizzes. Assignments went beyond what&#39;s covered in class or even anything that matters. Professor makes exams hard, beyond what&#39;s covered so that median is low. Very harsh, unpleasant person to talk to if you say something that&#39;s contrary to his beliefs. Reads straights out of the teaching guide for mandatory lecture.Lecture material is slow &amp; clear, but unfortunately assignments\/exams go far beyond what&#39;s covered. Self-learning from the book is not adequate.Contrary to many reviews, Doerschuk&#39;s class was organized. A very caring professor who spent times outside of class to go over HW. His prelims are definitely fair when you study for them. He held review session, which I recommend.","difficulty":3.8260869565,"rating":2.7826086957},{"index":1895,"prof_name":"Adam Bojanczyk","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"ECE230","comment":"one of the nicest teachers i have had.

Very willing to help students. Class is quite easy to understand.I don&#39;t know what the hell the first reviewer is talking about. Suh is a very clear lecturer. He knows how to pace the material and make it interesting. His exams were fair (2 hour long prelims for 1.5 hours of material), and he engaged the entire class in his lectures. Overall, an excellent instructor.very monotone lectures. its easy to fall asleep in 2300 with him. he also made the labs harder than need be by restricting use of verilog to the last few labs.Very clear lecture and grading criteria, extremely organized. Prof. Albonesi teaches so well that there is no need to read the textbook. Homeworks are well designed and those are the questions you&#39;d get on the exams. Best ECE professor I&#39;ve met!Lectures were sometimes impossible to follow either because the slides were far too vague or he moved too fast to be able to internalize the information being sprayed at us. Any notes taken on the slides by the professor were never uploaded even though multiple request were made to do so. Felt like an under-prepared power point presentation.Work for 2300 with him never ends, you have an assignment due 4-5 days out of a week. His lecture pace ranges from painfully slow to hopelessly faced passed. His lecture slides do not clear up information very well and are filled with abbreviations for terms that aren&#39;t explained.Very knowledgeable and you can tell there is a lot more to learn from him beyond the beginning level ECE course I took.After completing my ECE degree, I think 2300 with Suh was the worst ECE class I took.This guy is completely under-appreciated. Although I had him for my engineering 1050, and he showed up maybe twice and made his TA organize everything.  For 2300 (the class that mattered), he was the exact opposite, he was very clear with his lectures and tried to make sure everyone understood the material. So far 2300 has been my favorite class.The course is not supposed to be difficult but this guy manages to make it very painful. The labs are extremely tedious, if not impossible. Also, he does not put emphasis on what we should know in order to prepare for labs and exams. I was completely fooled as this guy put prelim1 date after the drop period. He is very harsh too.Suh was a really great professor. He was a little mean when it came to prelim conflicts, workload and stuff but overall he was really good. And the grad TA&#39;s were awesome. Finals were harder than usual though.Very unclear and disorganized lectures. Labs very time consuming and do not relate to exam material. Exam material is also difficult.Unclear and boring lectures. You will likely spend hours debugging labs. Lecture attendance isn&#39;t technically mandatory, but he gives pop quizzes every other week or so. There will be a point in the semester when you have an assignment due every weekday, none of which are easy or timely. Tests are very difficult.Really easy to fall asleep during lecture- speaks in monotone, not very clear.  Projects take *forever*. The program Quartus is *infuriating*. The only reason our labs were awesome was our amazing TA. You spend so much time on the projects, you forget to study everything else. Bad, because tests are only on the everything else. So. much. time.Albonesi is a kind, caring professor. The beginning of this course was very clearly laid out in his lecture notes, but the computer organization portion required extra time outside of the class to really learn. That said, his tests were beyond fair and I plan on taking another course with him next semester.I came into ECE 2300 with no experience in Digital Logic. This professor has not really improved my understanding of the material even from the very beginning of the course. I can&#39;t ever understand what he is saying. The prelims are absolutely nothing like any of the practice questions. insanely too much work in this course. Don&#39;t take it!!!His notes are ECE 2300 Bible, follow them and you can&#39;t fail!Knows the material well, but reuses slides and lectures can be a bore. The course is not run very well - homeworks\/labs are never returned in anything close to a timely matter and the grading procedure is a mess. This class isn&#39;t terrible but is often extremely frustrating.I felt that he made very complicated material extremely simple.  I left both classes (230 &amp; 314) feeling like I knew everything those classes covered absolutely.  He was so good at explaining in lecture that the pace even felt slow even though a lot was covered.  So far, my favorite courses in ECE.Prof. Zhang was one of the BEST professors I have had here! I took this class for fun, but after it, I decided to minor in ECE. The material was presented so clearly it would be hard not to learn. Sometimes the labs can be annoying and tedious (but I admit I did not put in as much effort as I should) , but the problem sets were informative and fun!AMAZING lecturer, probably best one I&#39;ve had at Cornell so far. Explains things very clearly but he does go very fast. Pop quizzes every lecture but not hard. Very caring professor, take this class with him!!He has &#34;pop quizzes&#34; every lecture which is like attendance, but he tells you to start paying attention when he teaches you the stuff that will be on the quiz that day, so people can wake up from naps and actually learn. This course does require a lot of work, so beware, but you learn the material from them and prelims are not that bad.Prof Zhang is definitely not the worst professor out here; he does care about students. However, his lectures were extremely dry and he moves very fast. He knows his stuff, but this works to his disadvantage because he oftentimes forgets to explain the things that seem trivial to him but not to his students.He&#39;s a really excellent lecturer and he makes jokes and plays games so we aren&#39;t bored all the time. He makes the material so much easier to understand. It&#39;s actually not a hard class and really interesting too, but it all builds up. Expect quizzes about 90% of the time. I would definitely take the class, we do really cool stuff here.I think he recently became a professor so he works very hard and try to teach the material well. That&#39;s what I like about relatively young professors compared to old professors waiting to retire and prepare nothing before lectures. He answers Piazza questions real fast. He works hard but I have to admit, he is extremely boring so try to stay awake.This course was a fantastic introduction to logic design. The professor explained the basics clearly, and labs were VERY illustrative and interesting. Some of them were more open-ended, but they were challenging and I learned a lot.Notes are amazing.Bojanczyk is probably one of the worst lecturers I have ever encountered. The classes are completely incoherent, with Bojanczyk simply reading off slides in a monotonous, sleep-inducing voice. The book is better than the professor, who has not really improved my understanding of the subject. Do not take this class unless your major requires it.Clear, well-organized lectures, though not super interesting.  Labs are incredibly time consuming but also helpful.  They will teach you the material and prepare you for later classes.  Homework was manageable but not something to write off.  Tests were very fair- tested class material well.  Easy to get an A.Acts menacing, and is menacing. Explains concepts clearly in lecture (you MUST go to lecture), but labs can be near impossible. Tests are very tricky, and practice is not relevant: you need a good intuition to do well on the exams. Learned a lot from the class, okay professorBest prof ever!Exams are not fair, labs are tedious and boring, avoid this prof for 2300.Took his intro digital logic design class in Spring 2010. Really nice guy. Lectures were clear and understandable. Exams were fair. Assignments and labs were fun. Class was too early in the morning though which sucked because he made attendance mandatory.Excellent professor!  Spent a lot of time making clear and useful lecture PPTs.  He is an excellent lecturer, spoke very clearly and precisely.  Very fair policies, exams, and grading.  Take 2300 with him!A really nice guy who explains things well. Lectures are good and tests are fair. Prelabs take a long time and are somewhat difficult.I really liked this guy. His lectures were very clear and he posts his lecture notes online, which are PPT slides that compliment the textbook well. This class is time consuming, but to no fault of the professor. Homework isn&#39;t too bad, but some of the pre-labs can take forever. Still, make sure you do them. Otherwise, you won&#39;t get out of lab.Best professor I have had at Cornell! His lectures are basically what made me interested in computer architecture. Though he may not be the most interesting lecturer, he is extremely straightforward and is very genuinely helpful. He&#39;s an awesome person outside of class as well and I look forward to asking him for help\/advice in the future.","difficulty":3.0540540541,"rating":3.6216216216},{"index":1897,"prof_name":"Adam Bojanczyk","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"ECE231","comment":"Can&#39;t understand anything he says and can&#39;t read anything he writes on the boardNo Comments","difficulty":3.0,"rating":3.0},{"index":1898,"prof_name":"Adam Bojanczyk","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"ECE232","comment":"No CommentsNot very easy to understand","difficulty":2.0,"rating":3.5},{"index":1899,"prof_name":"Jose Martinez","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"ECE2400","comment":"Funny and engaging lectures.

Genuinely one of the kindest professors at CornellVery clear lecturer, if you go to class and put in some degree of effort, youll learn the material and do well in his courses. He wants everyone to succeed.One of the best lecturers at Cornell. Clearly puts in a lot of effort into teaching his classes and conveys difficult subject matter lucidly. Homework assignments are difficult and time consuming, but doable, especially with his recitation sections. Exams are some of the hardest I&#39;ve taken at Cornell (much harder than homework assignments).Really clear an enthusiastic lecturer.

I had no idea what probability was before class, but left with a solid foundational knowledge that has been really helpful in later classes (ML, robotics, etc.).Excellent, if a bit quirky, lecturer.

Prof. Sirer had another prof. take over for him, but cut him some slack - he said it was due to a family emergency. Overall, a memorable class where I learned a lot.This class was supposed to be the most time intensive core EE\/CS course. For some reason, the 4 killer projects got shrunk to 2 (3rd optional) which covered the first 2 of the 4 topics. The last project was supposed to be so hard it took the place of a final.  We ended up having to copy diagrams from our texts. Could have been cool. Was not.No CommentsA very hard teacher--types like I&#39;ve never seen--but brilliant and very easy to talk to when help is neededVery disorganized, unprepared.\n Sirer did practically nothing except show up- sometimes. He doesn&#39;t know anything about the projects he reuses. And he likes to spring surprises on you (some good, some bad), like changing exam dates at the last moment, and making it closed-book and 2 1\/2 hours long.Reeves had absolutely no interaction with his 314 class, as far as I could see. Everything is left to the undergrad and grad TAs. Unfortunately, many of the TAs are pretty overworked and unable to communicate. Recipe for student frustration.He is an excellent lecurer. Made the class intersting by showing how the material applies to real world applications.This professor screwed up ECE 314. This course was destroyed because there was no project. This was blamed on &#34;not being able to install the software.&#34; How can you not be able to install software?? This professor was lazy and not organized. He stopped giving HW in October! Writes too small on the board, very unclear. Worthless.Abysmally-bad ECE professor who is completely unaware of the course curriculim, doesn&#39;t care about students understanding the material, uses someone else&#39;s power-point slides without even checking to see what&#39;s on them and if they&#39;re relevant.It&#39;s hard for me to rate him, because he got some grad student to teach lecture instead of him, even though he was still listed as professor. Needless to say, that did not make for a very good semester. The course is very difficult.The reason there is such a disparity among these ratings is that there were two lectures taught by this prof. and Victor Aprea. I switched up which lecture i went to sometimes, and they were both good.He isn&#39;t strong with the A\/D circuit portion of the course, but he is very clear on the CS material. His lectures became great when he put away the aged powerpoint slides and started teaching with the blackboard. It&#39;s a shame that there was a month left of class when he did that.","difficulty":3.5384615385,"rating":3.0},{"index":1910,"prof_name":"Gookwon \"Edward\" Suh","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"ECE3140","comment":"Not too much work until the end of the semester. Exams are purely based on memorizing lecture content, which is quite unclear sometimes due to his accent. If you miss small details, your exam score will suffer. Very, very boring lectures.He gives decent lectures but really lazy and sometimes even secretive. For example he would refuse to give out even homework solutions. Also he even flat out refused to answer students&#39; questions about grading because according to him &#34;it&#39;s not productive to wonder about your grades&#34;doesn&#39;t know his slides. gets confused in the middle of lecture.  doesn&#39;t necessarily know the topics at hand very well, though he may have at one point. makes stupid analogies. answers questions in the most round-about way.  the homework he assigns can get tedious.Awesome class.Martinez is a great teacher, he knows his stuff! Class wasn&#39;t too much work at all, there are roughly weekly quizzes, two prelims and no final. The only problem was that he had really sparse lecture notes, so you had to pay close attention in class and take good notes to do well. Overall, I would recommend taking a class with him.The topic material is pretty boring but Suh tries his best. Hes pretty nice and is always willing to help out. Lectures are clear, just gotta find a way to stay awake. Screw all those people sitting in the back that start talking near the end of lecture even while hes still lecturing.after this class switched to prof Napp and changed to online, ECE 3140 went from a hugely difficult class to one that is passable with little effort and you can get an A with a decent amount of effort.Long is a joke.  Doesn&#39;t know his own slides, gets confused by his own slides, contradicts the textbook on the day of a prelim and then later admits he&#39;s wrong, posts homework late, changes homeworks a few days before they&#39;re due, has stupid procedures for homeworks, can&#39;t answer homework questions correctly in class.  Is extremely boring.  Awful.It seems that he was just thrown into teaching this class without really preparing for it at all. Since he is a new professor at Cornell, that may be his fault or someone else&#39;s fault, but either way, the class is a complete mess and no one knows what&#39;s going on.Made class super interested. Always stopped to make sure people were following and understanding concepts. Labs were really enjoyable. Exams were fair and he gave like 3 hours to do them (exams only had like 4-5 problems each)Funny guy and decent lecturer, but super lazy. He literally canceled several lectures for no reason. And he absolutely refused to give out practice prelims and homework solutions for studying. Also he (probably deliberately) left important parts of his lecture slides blank.

Was a great combination with Lal for 315.I can&#39;t believe how bad the two professors for this course are.  how do they expect us to learn anything from such an important class when we don&#39;t have any good professors or ta&#39;s?Horrible class! He goes through the material at break-neck speed and then blames US for not knowing the material well! He thinks every one of us majors in ECE 315 but he&#39;s sadly mistaken. This stinking class is yet another of Cornell&#39;s bad core classes.No CommentsThe course, the book and Shealy&#39;s teaching attitude\/ability left me with a feeling that a large part of my tuition money has been spent by Dick Shealy on pregaming before the lectures. The guy is smart, but makes no effort to teach the class. The amount of information this course covers is ridiculous. Labs and homeworks are devices for torture!It is true that ECE 315 is among the hardest course in ECE department..and you will hate shealy after the first prelim. But if you ask for help (be sure to say no if you don&#39;t understand), shealy is extremely helpful. after taking the course, you will learn a lot and realize shealy is a great profHe doesn&#39;t know how to calculate standard deviation of an exam =P there&#39;s no way that the SD of a prelim is 44.Definitly a genious. Funny. Has pride in GaAs, but from what I hear, it sucks!~ Always complained that the prof of the class before him wrote too high~! Says he was in a fratTotally disastrous class. You definitely have to read the textbook to keep up with him. His exams are killer - the only way to survive is to make a super comprehensive &#34;cheatsheet&#34; to bring into exam, and just copy every crap on ur cheatsheet onto the exam.Bad temper. Has half a bottle of whiskey on him before going to lab. Makes exams insanely hard. Is a freaking genius. Willing to help, as long as he is in a good mood. But a nice guy none the less.This class is probably a hard class itself, and it&#39;s not Shealy&#39;s fault.  A lot of notes to copy,and material is covered very quickly, probably because Shealy expects everyone to be as smart as him.  But I have to say, he IS a very smart prof. An intellectually stimulating course.Knows his stuff but is really hardcore.  He always made me laugh so that made a hard class a little easier in lecture.  Don&#39;t blame Shealy, 315 is a hard hard class.  Plus I drank with him one night at the 9s.  Classic.Nice person, never gets personal with students. Class is hard but it is possible to get an A. Take him.This is a hard course both to take and to teach, but this was just awful.  He tries, but it just doesn&#39;t work.  Be prepared for a very disorganized course.No CommentsI can&#39;t wait until this class is over.  Absolutely awful.WHat abad professor...so unorganized. Don&#39;t take 315 with him. He&#39;ll make you want to drop ECE. We should have more profs like delchamps and less ones like Lal.lal is not as bad as everyone says.  he is relaxed and sometimes makes jokes that are funny.Honestly, this was probably the worst ECE class ever.  I would&#39;ve been far better off skipping class and just reading the book.  His lectures were a completely disorganized and confusing.No Commentsokay... no one understands his lectures.  no one in the class knows how to do the hw.  he&#39;s missed more lectures than all of my other professors combined.  i&#39;m missing other things but just thinking about this gives me a headache!Great professor! I mean, the class itself is hard, but Dr. Kan is a fantastic teacher and a very nice, helpful guy. Work hard and you will do just fine.Shows salient effort and care in teaching the students well.  Prepared for lectures and organizede. No textbook, only his thorough notes. Unfortunately his explanations were not very clear to me.He is a great professor, but his exams were really hard. He did his best with a crappy course in general. His class was very helpful for those going into the computer engineering industry.this guy cannot teach at all.  his lectures are just bits and pieces of the lecture notes posted by the book authors, his explanations suck, he&#39;s a sneaky ****, pushing back our test past the drop date so we can&#39;t dropwhen we all fail the test.Horrible. Worst professor I have ever had. Avoid at all costs. Very unprepared. Very unclear. Doesn&#39;t know what he is doing. He wrote the worst midterm of all time. It was full or spelling errors and typos. He probably hadn&#39;t even solved the problems himself. In a class like 315 where the book is notoriously poor, you need better than Prof Spencer!He can&#39;t teach and it is an awful class to begin with.  Friendly guy but the class is awful with pointless lab reports that require all nighters.Terrible lectures, unorganized notes, forgets to assign\/return homework, shows up to tests late, told us there was no time limit and then wrote &#34;30 MIN LEFT&#34; on the board an hour into the prelim, worthless labs requiring individual reports separate from your partner, answers questions with &#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; doesn&#39;t respond to emails, etc.  Awful.she&#39;s actually very nice in lab, knows her stuff and is willing to help. she&#39;s not that good at lecturing, but definitely someone who makes an attmept to help her students.Soo lost in this class...dunno why I&#39;m still in itPlease avoid this professor.

HOWEVER, it is a tad difficult. Also how could you make the final design night lab wednesday.... This is absolutely ridiculous in terms of timing. Why do so many of the students give him a 5.0 rating when they keep repeating difficult and tough grader? let me be an actual honest reviewer.This was by far the most difficult class I have taken at Cornell. Too much material was covered in a single course. And exams were also tough. But Rana is a super good lecturer, very sharp, clear,  and to the point. Almost scary. The course material was also organized extremely well (better than any book) and  I learnt a lot.              For the class that had so much material, Rana was really good at picking out the main points, stressing them, and without sacrificing any rigor.  The class was also structured very well, having good coverage of semiconductor physics and Only cares about grades, he&#39;s a good lecturer but the constant focus on exams and grading instead of the actual subject ruined my enthusiasm for the subject.3150 is one of the hardest ECE courses at Cornell, and there is a lot to get through. Shealy has to go fast, but he really cares that we learn from him and understand the material. The homework and labs are tough and time-consuming but they reinforce the material really well and solidify our analog circuit skills. In OH Shealy is super helpful too.Lectures are very clear and slides are well done. However, he makes the class revolve only around grades by always saying &#34;this can be on the final&#34; and publicly announcing top scorers on each assignment. Made me less interested in the subject.Rana is a very good lecturer. Maybe the best I have had at Cornell. His courses are known to be phenomenal learning experiences, and 3150 was the best course I have had so far. But his courses are not easy and if you are not interested in the subject matter, life can become hard. And don&#39;t skip classes or fall behind - there is no catching up.Rana has clear lectures and slides as long as you pay attention and dont sleep. Don&#39;t just only go to OH. Go to rana specifically for help understanding how to apply the concepts. Hes almost always free and there. He will help you.Great lecturer! But extremely difficult material and even more difficult exams. If he wasn&#39;t a fairly generous grader, the median on our midterm would&#39;ve been in the 30&#39;s. Through fairly generous grading, it ended up being in the low 60s.Rana looks mean but he is probs one of the nicest professors around. He made an otherwise difficult subject really lucid and he is super helpful with assignments. If you want a good grade, then the class would be a lot of work. Final was way easier than midterm, and grading was lenient.

We had 2 problem sets the whole semester which made it very difficult to learn the material otherwise. Project for the course was a lot of fun.Very hyped professor who mostly lives up to it. His grading scheme is designed for everyone in the class to get an A. DSP sort of bounces around between image processing (not that interested) and cooler stuff like multirate filters.

Furthermore, the exams and homework are heavily based on number crunching into long formulas, which do not test for understanding.I really suffered in this class. It was a hard class with too much material and too little class time. His lectures were unclear, the textbook was expensive and little used, but the exam material was more of his own stuff. He was misleading about exam material. Although he took pity gradewise, I really hated this class and it caused immense stressNot the first class I have with Professor Poitras. Cornell needs more like him. He knows his stuff, is available, actually cares about his students. The course is a little heavy, we covered a lot of material, but thats why Im at Cornell. The material is current, the final project great.Carl is a fantastic professor with tons of experience in the subject matter and gives excellent lectures.

At the end of the semester, we all became familiar on advanced topics in electromagnetism and metamaterials. The mean for the second prelim was 90, which I don&#39;t think is because the exam was too easy; rather, we were all taught so well, I think.ECE 4960 is one of the best courses that I have taken at Cornell.

The course material is very interesting and of major present research interest. Francesco is very patient and helpful during office hours. The course material is intrinsically quite challenging, but I think Francesco did a good job of selecting homework and exam problems of appropriate difficulty.As a graduate student specializing in the field of metamaterials this class was a great at filling up different gaps that I had in my knowledge of the subject. Professor Monticone did a terrific job at simplifying complicated concepts with concise examples. His choice of subjects for the class was on point.Homeworks are fairly straightforward and comprehensive. Provides plenty of feedback on homeworks and exams. Fairly lenient when it comes to grading and due dates. Good at explaining complex optical phenomena. Provides class notes and plenty of supplemental material (no textbook required).Amazing class.

Prof. Monticone is a great lecturer and is very knowledgeable about the subject. His notes have been very helpful, and I understand a lot more about the subject.Prof. Monticone clearly explained the fundamentals behind novel photonic phenomenon. As a graduate student doing research in this field, I find that all the materials discussed in this class very helpful. Prof. Monticone is very knowledgeable and nice. I always enjoy the in-depth research discussions with him.very knowledgeable in his field, good at answering questions, very friendly, gives relatively few homeworksA very good course. Course materials cover from fundamental concepts and theorems of electrodynamics to frontier research topics of complex electromagnetic media and nanophotonics.Taking this class with Prof. Monticone will ensure you have a deep understanding of e&amp;m while giving a ton of applications. It is a balanced class which can take your knowledge to the level of modern research or give you a basis for deep questions on light-matter interaction. His lectures are so well designed, it is like listening to a great story!Professor Monticone has a knack for taking complicated subjects and synthesizing clear explanations for them that do not involve complicated math. This is the second class I have taken with him and it has been a pleasure to attend his lecturesAn amazing course with advanced topics, which were very effectively conveyed by Prof. Monticone. I had an amazing experience in the class, and would recommend it without any hesitation.Both of Profesor Monticone&#39;s classes are very good. He is a very good teacher who puts a lot of effort into his lectures. He covers what&#39;s at the forefront of the field, but he makes it accessible. He is very fair in his grading.Well, his classes so far covered very specific topics--mostly related to his research interests--but he did an excellent job to engage students into those topics very naturally. He is really solid in organizing and pacing the class--not too fast and not too slow. It was great that he connects the class materials to classic or frontier researches.Course is enjoyable and educating. Prof. Monticone excels at summarizing a complex body of electrodynamics theory into a clear, coherent lecture. Course material covers cutting-edge research, but is thorough in its theoretical foundation to allow the student to perform own analysis. Optional reading will give the student strong grasp on material.","difficulty":3.2,"rating":5.0},{"index":1982,"prof_name":"Christina Delimitrou","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"ECE5990","comment":"This was a super interesting course!

Overall, take it!Genius, and he is famous toohonestly, she might be harder than some other profs but you will walk out of the class and feel like you learned something. shes teaches a bit fast but explains everything really clearly.  i took micro and macro with her at the same time and it really wasnt that bad.  i really liked her and her teaching style","difficulty":3.0,"rating":3.5},{"index":1996,"prof_name":"John Abowd","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"ECON101","comment":"Good prof.he is a terrible teacher. he does not use the book at all and tries to make jokes in lecture [only he thinks they are funny]. this is one of the worst classes i have ever taken. if you can stay away from this class and any other class he teachesNo CommentsHis explaination and powerpoint are crystal clear and TA&#39;s teaching is great. His assignments are bit much but the grading is fair and course materials are interesting.Decent lecturer.  Not too much work besides the tests and problem sets.  You&#39;ll do fine if you do the readings, go to lecture, and study for the tests.  The tests can be surprisingly difficult (all multiple choice) but the problems are usually similar to the assigned problem sets so make sure to study those well.made this unnecessarily hard.  and very very boring.I loved this class. Abowd is the best professor I have had so far at Cornell!Easy class, awful professor.  You don&#39;t really need to go to lectures, except he decided to take attendance.extremely clear; all the powerpoints are online so you dont even need to go to class.  aplia is a joke. the problem sets are easy unless you are retarded and dont know the basics of using excel (like most people in the class).  tons of practice problems online that are exactly the same as the problems on the tests.Nice guy. Bad teacher. Class sucks. Too many aplia problem sets. And he uploads them sometimes a day before they&#39;re due. Too many of my nights have been ruined by finding out at the last minute that there is a new aplia set due. Also, the prelims do NOT reflect what is taught in class or in the problem sets. For Excel sets, FORM A GROUP. Seriously.I guess I missed the part where he seemed &#34;arrogant.&#34; But, his lectures were like the only lectures which I looked forward to, because he always had funny and interesting examples to emphasize the point he was trying to make. I will admit though that his book is way too wordy and that his problems were very confusing at times.He is actually very helpful to students who needed help. His lecture slides rocks - I don&#39;t read textbooks. However, he dwells on the maths instead of the econs sometimes.She&#39;s really good at teaching the material, but talks excessively fast and makes the average way too low. ...C+ average?No CommentsOverkill for an intro class. Take Frank, or any other prof. And for 313, take Kichool Park over this lady. Park is much better at explaining and gives much nicer curve than she does.Horrible professor. Material covered in lectures does not match test. Lecture material is confusing. Her voice gets annoying after the second day. Avoid a class with her at all costsGreat professor! i had absolutely no prior econ knowledge and i got an A+ in the class because Abowd explains the material extremely well. It&#39;s not an easy class but definitely manageable if you put in the time. those who say you need previous calc\/econ knowledge and claim that abowd is a bad professor are just idiots who didn&#39;t make an effort.Tom Evans is an amazing teacher. He makes every lecture interesting on some level, and his graphs and powerpoints are always very helpful. He&#39;s also just a really funny guy who tells good stories and bizarre examples that you&#39;ll be talking about after class.Loved Jenny W. She was hard for 101, but you really learn the material. Take her if you want to continue on with Econ.No CommentsYou can study like crazy for this class and still not do well because the homework is worth practically nothing and tests (which are very difficult) make up the majority of the final grade.  The class did my GPA no good whatsoever!!!Awful class, never uses the textbook but makes everyone buy it. I didn&#39;t learn anything in lecture, he makes everything unnecessarily hard, and there are waaaay too many problem sets. The tests are way to hard, and have trick questions in them.One of the worst profs I had at Cornell. Handled a situation where he accidently handed out Prelim answers instead of the blank bubble sheet horribly.Really smart guy. Funny too. If you research him he&#39;s actually quite high up in the world of economics. I mean, hell, he co-wrote the textbook with the chairman of the federal reserve. Read The Economic Naturalist.very straight forward and fair, definitely learn the material well from himGreat class. The attendence thing was just to help your grade, so no one should complain about that. His lectures are great and he&#39;s a nice guy. He&#39;s the best there is for 101.He was a great professor and one of the best lecturers I have had at Cornell. I never thought he was &#34;arrogant&#34; or talked down to his students, but hey I guess everyone&#39;s got a different opinion. I wish he taught more econ classes.He is a great lecturer. His examples are really interesting and easy to understand. He doesn&#39;t make you memorize stupid things like some econ teachers do. He focuses on the important concepts. I liked the writing assignments but I wish they weren&#39;t graded on interestingness which is very subjective.I really don&#39;t know what everyone&#39;s beef with Wissink is. She talks fast but if you stay with it you will appreciate that she&#39;s not wasting your time going over things a million times like other profs do. I got an A and there&#39;s nothing stopping everyone else from doing the same except for laziness.This guy is absolutely great at lecturing, no question about it. Other than that, his class sucks. Taking attendance? Economics essays graded on interestingness? In a 300 person class, are you serious? All you need to get an A in this class is to study old exams because he reuses questions on his lame multiple choice tests. Bad elective ..If you think Econ is easy, don&#39;t take this class.While a great professor and a smart guy, he is arrogant and not helpful in office hours.Ugh, this guy makes me sick.  He makes sweeping generalizations and treats students like they&#39;re idiots.  Someone needs to deflate his ego.wissink is very annoying.  her voice is aggravating and her examples are stupid.  the grading was ok, not super easy, but decent.  overall, i&#39;m going to avoid taking classes with her for the next 2 years.I don&#39;t know why everyone thinks the class is so hard.  I couldn&#39;t imagine an easier class than econ 101.  Despite her corny jokes and flaky personality, she is a good teacher.  My TA (Jing) is also very good, very accomodating, and very nice.No CommentsNo CommentsHer TA&#39;s do not speak the native language, aka english for all you curve breakers out there.  The women looks like Alanis Morreset, thats not a good thing.  The subject is easy but the Prof is hard, now isn&#39;t that ironicI think she is the best teacher at Cornell.  She should never cut her hair because it is so long and cool.  I think everyone should be taking her class because she is such a good teacher.          P.S.  Her glasses are greatLectures are boring, TAs are unhelpful and I learned legit nothing from this class. I understand econ but it isn&#39;t because I took this classsuper hard class, esp. if you&#39;ve never taken econ before.  large gaps in material b\/w what is actually learned and whats on the tests.   practically no curve and really low avg.  also, no TA&#39;s for this course speak any english at all.No CommentsIt was so hard to wake up knowing id have to sit through her fast-paced rambling lectures. I heard Wissink is brilliant, but I couldn&#39;t stand micro because I could never keep up with her lectures. Get takenote and go to section, then youll be fine.I thought she was a horrible prof. She goes to fast, especially for people who don&#39;t have a background in econ. She isn&#39;t helpful at all and her tests are incredibly hard and cover EVERYTHING that is in lecture and in the book. YOu have to study!!Very poor instructor--the worst one I had at Cornell. In terms of learning basic microeconomics, you could easily find a much better teacher at a public high school, a community college, or literally anywhere else. I don&#39;t think anyone would learn very much about economics from her powerpoint slides. And all she does is read them.Is deciding if she&#39;s going to curve our grades based on our &#34;behavior.&#34; A psychotic and manipulative professor.Wissink&#39;s lectures were sometimes disorganized and a little hard to follow, but she is very friendly.  The exams were way harder than they needed to be, and I felt unprepared based on the material she gave.  The worst part was by far the TAs, who did not have a firm grasp of the English language, making them nearly useless.This was the class that made me scared of college.  Everything that I did in it seemed to be wrong, and she was of no help to me in the time I approached her.Great Professor. Very Clear, very helpful. I always felt prepared for exams.REGRET taking her class. Everything about her just screams &#34;horrible.&#34; Agree with post below. She doesn&#39;t know how to lecture. She appears really friendly when talking in front of the class, but isn&#39;t in-person. Regret taking her class so much but it&#39;s too late to drop now...her stories and anecdotes make the boring econ interesting... problem sets are tough, but the TAs grade easily... and multiple choice exams!Slow down!Tough class, but she is a great teacher.Professor is a total jackass.  Taking attendance at a 300-student lecture?  Give me a break.  He is so arrogant and ridiculously full of himself.  Dont take this class unless you have no other choice.pretty clear and fair, a bit arrogant, but not too hard to succeedNo CommentsProfessor Abowd is very clear about what he expects of students and the material covered.  If you put in the time, you can easily do well in this course.He&#39;s a very good teacher and the reason I like economics.Class is easy, but this guy&#39;s a total jerk.  Completely arrogant, and rushes through lecture assuming you&#39;ve already printed out the lecture from online.  Lectures are also a complete bore.Great lecturer. Difficult grader. However because of his introductory course, I chose to become an econ major.Very clear and organized lecturer.  He gives multiple choice exams that can be a little tricky, but his practice exams are the same as the real thing.  Hardly studdied, easy A.Good lecturer. Grading was unfair.No CommentsEasy A.you aren&#39;t going to find a better lecturer, she goes over the material very throughly and the tests are definitely fairNo CommentsShe&#39;s the worst professor I&#39;ve had so far.  She goes way too fast in lecture, and the tests were too hard.  One time, I stayed after class to ask her a question.  After waiting for 5 mintutes, she told me to look for the answer on the webpage.Good prof.  Reasonable tests.  Take her class for ECON 101.I thought her lectures were terribly boring.No Commentsthat himeself ,rubbish classcm1029.Abowd is a very egotistical prof\u2026 usually annoying to listen to in lecture. Teaches the class as if it&#39;s an advanced econ course; &#39;expected&#39; to have prior econ knowledge\/ have already taken calc in order to keep up.. Aplia and Excel problem sets are very annoying &amp; excessive; For the prelims, * study the old practice tests * and you will be fine.He&#39;s a fair grader, though I really hate his exams (they are ALL multiple choice.) I also hated the online homework that was assigned. Learned a bit in this class, but felt like it was somewhat slower than any other class I&#39;ve taken at Cornell.HORRIBLE TEACHING! Unclear and unfair! Try and get another professor.Lectures are concise and to the point. He is very helpful, always willing to answer questions. If you do the readings and the review problems, the prelims are really easy.Clear, thorough lectures.Makes book nearly unnecessary. Excel problem sets are a LOT of work and very in-depth. Aplia.com assignments are annoying but not too bad. Other than that, his tests are fair and he is not unreasonable for grading. Very accomodating to any sort of problems you may have. Get Judit or Fernando as your TA, and you&#39;ll be fine.I went to exactly two lectures, the rest you can just watch online on your computer. Do the practice problems and ace his tests. Sure it&#39;s boring but it is easy.Relatively easy class; I just read the book, mainly because I find no point in the lectures. The Excel Problem Sets can be a pain, and Aplia can get annoying, but the worst are the Prelims, not because they are hard, but because the multiple choice messes you up so badly! It&#39;s like the SAT all over again. Abowd is boring at points, but still nice.Tries to be funny, just comes off as a super nerd. However, hes a great guy and knows what he is talking about. He is the professor to take if you need to take this class. Grading system is pretty lax and the problem sets allow for a huge grade boost.very easy class, but he wastes too much time at tests (most start 30 minutes late). don&#39;t bother going to lectures because he just cant teach, just read the textbook and do the practice problems. do all of the old test questions to study.you better do the aplia problem sets! His lectures are very boring, but the class is pretty easy. Do the old prelim problems on his website. beware of t he excel problem sets, they could take over your life.very easy class.. no need to go to lectures, just read txtbooks and slides.. prelims are pretty straightforward. If you do aplia and excel problem sets, won&#39;t have difficultiesHe&#39;s actually a pretty cool guy.  He&#39;s may come off as cocky, but on the whole very responsive to students and helpful.  Just go to lecture and keep up with your work and you&#39;ll do fine.The man loves APLIA, in an almsot creepy way. He has put everything online and makes not going to class very easy. Pre-lims are simple copies of practice questions he puts online. If you do go to lecture I find him to be very concise. There is always plenty of material and review sessions to catch up and figure out the information before tests.No CommentsThe class is much easier than I would have thought for a big intro class in this school. The tests are ALL multiple choice. The Excel P sets are kind of difficult but you have plenty of time to get them done. He&#39;s alright as a lecturerHe is a really nice prof. His lectures are boring sometimes but his tests are easy.Since lecture isn&#39;t mandatory, and they are videotaped and available on blackboard, you don&#39;t have to go to class.  The text is pretty good and TAs will help with the problem sets (if you don&#39;t know kids who took the class in previous years--questions are similar). Tests aren&#39;t bad at all, very fair.i hated this dude - i even talked to him personally to resolve some issues about submitting stuff online and i still hated him - take the course cause it&#39;s easy but hate him and do you&#39;re hwAbowd likes to use smiles and write &#34;heheheh&#34; during market experiments. Problem sets count a lot and never ever leave excell problem sets to within a week of the due date, no joke.Great class. I like that she treats us as adults and makes so much available.  You have to use the Web pages but if you do everything is up there.  She&#39;s also great if you stop by during office hours.  Lots of help.  And candy too!Very clear with his instruction, but hard to respect as a person...he was incredibly rude to his TAsHer econ 101 class gave me my lowest grade at Cornell ever, and in every other econ class i&#39;ve taken I&#39;ve gotten at least a B+!!!!!! She is ridiculously hard.I agree.  Her hair irritated me immensely.  I mean, why?as long as you do well on the prob sets and the project you&#39;ll pass this classHe is not clear at all! His examples are too complicated. The TA knows more than he does! Plus she teaches better! She makes you understand.Hes a man of the digital age, all his slides are online so lectures are kinda pointless.  Pretty easy class with easy prelims.  Not too hard to get a good grade.this class is an assult on everything right and good about humanity. i hope john abowd burns in hell.speaks clearly, but moves too fast. tests are very difficult, and most of the TA&#39;s don&#39;t speak english.\n not easy to get a good grade in this class!I hate her, she talks so fast and moves through the slides every 20 seconds. This class was so depressing &amp; ridiculously boring, I was never able to stay entirely awake through a class! The tests are sooo hard too! You think you did well but end up with a 50%...what the hell?! Don&#39;t take this class unless you&#39;re already really good at econ.Have fun in lectures!Speeds through lecture notes...had no idea how she was getting the answers she was getting. Homework and problem sets, although time consuming, grade boosters. TA&#39;s very helpful and critical in your grade. Not a good TEACHer at all in my mind.He&#39;s a pretty boring lecturer. He basically reads off of his Powerpoint Presentations. +&#39;s= he can get pretty hi-tech if he wants to. He explains everything fairly well. His prelims aren&#39;t difficult. -&#39;s he adds random things on the final. This yr, his TA&#39;s had trouble with english. he&#39;s okLecture slides are very clear; makes concepts simple to understandDon&#39;t go to lectures, download the notes from the site. If you go to the lectures, it will drive you to drink.Way too much work for intro micro. Problem sets are a pain and the final project is absolutely a waste of time and energy. That said, should be an easy A if you keep up with the lecture slides. He reads straight off slides (posted online) in lecture, so don&#39;t bother going.relatively easy class.  no point of buying textbooks when lecture slides were great.Definitely not a fan of economics, but overall a good course and good teacher.His lectures are the worst. I havent been to one forever... You can watch them online. Kind of boring class... The online experiments are fun though...Find out when group proj. is &amp; just go to section then; no need to go to lecture, b\/c lecture notes posted online; take pbsets seriously (free 25% of grade); do prac. tests and review pbsets b4 exams. I didn&#39;t read lect. notes\/study till day before exams, got B&#39;s, pbset\/group proj got me A- in classI was scared going in because of the terrible ratings from past semesters.  He must have read those too and changed his style becuase he wasnt bad at all.He&#39;s a really cool guy. The whole class is very thourgh. I dont know about these other kids, but the tests sucked. The problem sets were easy and so was the project. But dang those tests.Easy class if you try at all. Lectures are optional - go if you need to, or you could just read the slides online. Tests are very easy. No curve - dont really need it. The prof is reasonable and pretty chill.Class is very well structured.  Excel problem sets take a bit of time to do, but serve as a good review for the prelims.  Lecture is extremely boring.  She speaks a lot but doesn&#39;t really say anything.Difficult exams, speeds through lectures, excel PS are long. She&#39;s really nice but it&#39;s really difficult to follow in class when she goes through the Powerpoint unless you know the materials already.No Commentsgreat teaching style, tricky prob sets and examsIt really bothered me how long her hair was.  In fact, it made me angry.  And I didn&#39;t especially like her stories.He is a great lecturer. You never need the textbook - his notes are fantastic as well as his problem sets. His exams are tough but he curves them a lot so everyone does ok in the end. If you study his notes and problem sets though you&#39;ll end up doing well (with the curve of course.)mean spirited, did not seem to really care about students who needed help like i didHe&#39;s really not a bad guy.  I asked him a question and he replied in a promptly.  It&#39;s impossible to do badly on his tests because he GIVES YOU SIMILAR EXAMS ON THE COURSE WEBSITE!  That said, I messed up one of the tests but I blame myself. A very nice guy.If you take Econ 101, it&#39;ll be fun and easy to learn. Getting a good grade isnt too hard if you read or go to lecture.The WORST teacher at Cornell, if you have him try to change to another teacher--he&#39;ll ruin your semester with his pretentious attitude and boring lectures.I think it&#39;s hard to teach a class of 400.  He does a fairly good job with managing everything using his website.  It would be nice if he picked TAs which were better at teaching.  Mine just can&#39;t communicate with the class.Undoubtedly, the world&#39;s greatest argument against tenure. Has no regard for the questions\/concerns of students; horrible lectures. The class is easy though so enroll and don&#39;t show up.this class is useless.  abowd needs to learn that his aplia assignments and experiments are utterly pointless and dont help at all.  his lectures are incredibly boring, and in an attempt to redeem himself he gives out bagels and frisbees in class.  I&#39;m not usually one to be critical of a professor or class, but this is particularly bad.Professor Abowd is extremely boring and stuck up.  Avoid his class at all costs, he does not even try to make a naturally boring subject, econ, fun and exciting.  I think he has stopped teaching.My view is slanted since I suck at Econ, but I do think he assigns a little too much work for only three credits. That having been said, the work helps you develop many different ways of looking at the problems. Prof. Abowd is not a bad guy. Just do the Excel problem sets well in advance and ALL of the old prelims to prepare for the exams.No Commentshe was so ridiculously unhelpful when my group was having serious troubles completing our project due to a very poor topic.  really, he was just a mega huge jerk about the whole thing.Wasn&#39;t really that big a fan of her, but it was an ok class.I took Econ 101 with Abowd a few years ago.  What a jerk!  I had emailed him a simple question, and he wrote back something like &#34;Can&#39;t you read?! It&#39;s posted on the website!&#34;  People like this should not be teaching, especially at a place lAbowd taught me econ during my first semester at Cornell, and he was so pretensious and unhelpful!  Very closed off when approached by friends for grade disputes, too reliant on his TA&#39;s, moody and possibly resentful of having to teach a 100 level.No CommentsElective?  Seemed like torture to me.Very nice prof. Gives prizes when you answer questions. Also very understanding. When you need an extension for a valid reason, he is likely to help you with that.When I emailed Professor Abowd about a question, he emailed it to all the TAs (and back to me) asking &#34;whose student is this? why are they wasting my time?&#34; and continued to insult me personally, as well as my TA.The worst experience I&#39;ve had in my four years at Cornell as a dual major. I&#39;d suggest trying to take ECON 101 with any other professor, unless of course, you deal with a lot of arrogance in an intro econ course.You will definitely learn micro, Abowd is a great professor.  He&#39;s so lame but it&#39;s adorable and he throws goodies into the crowd if you just try to answer in class.  The prelims and final are multiple choice, which sucks or rocks depending on you.  Seriously BEWARE OF EXCEL PSETS.Lots of work.  Good class. Seemed like grading was going to be really hard, but she was really quite gentle in the end. She really put a lot of time into the Discussion Board.  Look at all her replies. That&#39;s dedication to the students.Give the guy a break... he&#39;s not THAT bad. Sure, his jokes are not funny at all, but he tries to teach, and does a decent job. Prelims are pretty easy, problem sets are a pain, and the TAs are a bit sketchy... but overall, it&#39;s alrightAbowd is an amazing professor. I found the aplia psets extremely helpful in getting students to keep up with the reading and his prelims\/final are extremely fair. excel psets take a while to do so start them early. this is definetely a good class to take because abowd really makes sure that you learn the material inside out. i wouldnt change a thinI don&#39;t know how people rated him badly - he&#39;s one of the nicest profs here.  He teaches everything so it&#39;s easy to understand and he puts ALL his notes online.  I even liked my TA.Very easy class. Don&#39;t even have to take the 2nd prelim if you ace the first one - he dropped one grade out of the 2 prelims and problem set average. very slow lecture pace, easy to understand and the prelims are an absolute jokeIf you&#39;re used to Engineering professors that can&#39;t speak english and write equations on the board without telling you what the variables mean like I am, this professor is a BREEZE.\n He teaches more clearly and easily and slowly than ANY of my Engineering profs. \n Lecture notes are AMAZING.\n Easy ClHe&#39;s a pretty bad teacher. Applia is such a waste of time.This course is a crap class!!..good for nothing and  prof abowd makes it worse...every week u end up doing rubbish aplia assignments wasting time learning just common-sense.Even if u say its easy but a considerable loss of time in the semester.Abowd is a very well organized and fair professor.  He teaches well and lets you know exactly what he expects.  If you put in the time you&#39;ll get a good grade.The class may put you to sleep.  The exams are pretty easy.Yea, he messed up by handing our answers instead of the prelim once, but short of that, his class was easy.  We had the choice to either read the book or go to class.  And even by sleeping through class without reading the textbook, its an easy class.Easy tests. Read off slides. Dont go to lectures.Great Intro teacher.

Pretty good overall, but who the hell curves an intro class to a C+?!!Horrible professor, seemed disinterested in teaching and focused on research. Hard to get in touch with. His merits are that he&#39;s quite a character and humorous. Expect to be teaching yourself the course through takenote.did a great job making us aware of what macro is all aboutI think he showed up **** to class quite a few times...great jobI am less inclined to think highly of Prof. Kyle, simply because his head TA cannnot get her act together. He should have been more thoughtful in his selection, she brings the whole cidate.ourse down, is unclear, and can&#39;t get anything right in her first email. Kyle should have used his Harvard education to pick a more suitable candshe seems to yell for the entire lecture, i&#39;ve thought of stabbing pencils through my eardrums, all of her examples relate to her family, i get really annoyed trying to listen to her and end of reading the daily sun all classWissink blabs and blabs and blabs. Quit yapping and say something clear, concise, and simple. We&#39;ll follow. Lectures organized, and otherwise a good professor. Tangents about Finland and family somewhat entertaining. Besides the talking, I liked her.Professor Kyle is a professor who is very interested in his subject and this is conveyed in his teaching.  I had never taken economics before but was surprised at how clear and relevant professor Kyle&#39;s lecture were.  The average is a B or B+, which is easy to obtain if you pay attention in lecture and go to section.  Section answer hw questions.THe lectures are very clear and interesting. The problem sets have nothing to do with the prelims. He does not give out A+s unless u get 100%. Pretty mad at him ~Wissink is the worst professor ever. She is rude during office hours and wastes time during lecture to talk about the history of economics instead of showing how to do problems and concepts that are on her prelims. The multiple choice questions on her prelims and final are worth so many points and really kill the overall test scores.Great teacher! She&#39;s so enthusiastic about the material and so thorough. Definitely take the practice exams before the tests because the prelims\/final are just like them. Also very nice and approachable during office hours.His lectures are not quite as structured as Wissink.  I wished the information was presented in a more definitive nature. The tests were okay. Not easy; but not hard. \n \n Your TA helps you to understand the information alot, so choose a good section.COTA wasn&#39;t as bad as others say.  Take it if you can, no final, but a paper, which was very easy.  Tests not too hard.very clear and intuitive lecture, TakeNote was great for the course - great guy.Take 102 from him if he&#39;s teaching it.  Very clear lecturer and usually has funny jokes.  Problem sets may not correspond that well to the book or lectures but they&#39;re still fairly easy to figure out.Teaches us intuition. Priceless!His fondness for Jack Daniels is in most graphs he uses. Very opinionated.Very interesting class, especially if you know nothing about ECON coming in to it.  Lectures not too structured, but prof very knowledgeable about material and always excited about teaching it.  Sections review material and do actual computation.  Great course no matter what major.ECON 102: This class is listed as 3 credits, but don&#39;t kid yourself; if you do all of the reading and all of the BUSYWORK problem sets on Aplia, it should be worth much more than 3.easy class... just make sure you read the textbook. you can get away with not going to lectures but make sure you go to sections-- the TA&#39;s actually cover useful material that will be on the exams. one final paper that is pretty easyEnthusiastic professor who puts a lot of effort into organizing lectures. Class material seems to go a lot faster than it did in Econ 101. You&#39;ll learn a lot from her.Take 102 from him. His lectures are okay, and you will learn from him. He is a very nice guy and really helpful. So long as you pay attention and do the readings, this class is very easy.For me to do as badly as I did in Macro and like her as much as I do is saying something! I am horrible at Econ as my grade in the class suggests, but she is a fabulous lecturer and unbelievably helpful in office hours.Wissink is so annoying. I can never wake up on time knowing i have to go to her class. It got to the point that i got takenotes just so i dont have to go.Terry Alexander is the best professor I ever had. He genuinely cares about his students and their success. He once wrote my name correctly on the board, and when he asked if it was correct I simply replied it doesnt matter. He promptly turned, made direct eye contact, and said of course it matters, its your name. Take his class.easy tests, easy (weekly) problem sets, but they don&#39;t really correspond with what&#39;s being taught in class.  seems like a nice guy who tries hard to be funny, and sometimes can be.  knows his stuffehEnthusiastic in class but she rambles sometimes in lecture and goes over the same stuff too much.  Grading is fair (definitely not generous) but you can&#39;t blame her for that, just her army of TAs.  Gives a little too much HW, in my opinion.Just a terrible professor.  There is really not much else to say.No CommentsWent to class about once a month - a pretty easy class, but lectures are very repetitive. Extra credit experiments are awesome - you get points and paid. A lot less work than ECON 101.No CommentsWissink sucked in every aspect possible. She should retire. Her tests were dreadful and she is dreadful. She also needs a hair cut as well as a serious attitude adjustment!Definitely sucked me into liking Economics ... of course, once I took micro, I hated the field, but Schulze definitely made the course easy (only a handful of ALGEBRAIC equations to remember for an entire final!!!).Okay Professor.  Half of every lecture is history\/politics and other stuff that isnt tested.  His tests are kinda hard but he tells you exactly what to study.  Plus he gives extra credit, so you can end up with a pretty decent grade.  I hear better things about him than Wissink.Very straightforward lectures.\n Find a good TA and go to their sections.\n Problem sets don&#39;t really correspond to the material. Fair, predictable tests.A very distinguished-looking prof.  Much better than Wissink- good lectures, easy problem sets, and fair prelimslove that mustacheKyle is smart and funny. He knows a lot about Econ. However, his lectures have a loose structure, and often ends up glazing over things that aren&#39;t in the textbook but are important. EVERYthing is fair game for final, even abstract and trivial things. If you love Econ, go for it, if not, it may be worth waiting someone else.Great professor. great class. Integrated current events and made class understandable and interestingKyle is pretty much what you would expect from a Harvard Ph.D. economist-- mustache, gray hair, really knows what he&#39;s doing; great lecturer.uses JD in all of his examples, teaching not really hi strong pointWilling to help at any second, professor Kyle is perhaps one of the best econ prof&#39;s in the dept. I&#39;d strongly recommend his 102 over any other.No CommentsVery good at lecturing.  Very clear, uses diagrams well.  Not great in office hours.  Exams are medium, but final paper takes a while.  Good class overall.She speeds through the material but sections help a lot.  The homework or exams aren&#39;t considerably difficult.  DO NOT LOOK AT HER UP CLOSE!! Scary, manProbably the easiest course since 3rd grade.  Seemed like he repeated his lectures enough to go to every other lecture (or once a month!).  All you need to understand is one equation and put numbers into it.  Missed only one question  all semester!First of all she talks a million words per minute. Not only that but she speaks and writes so verbously it hard to sort through what has meaning and what does not.Professor Schulze gave us a &#34;Schulze Day&#34; where we did not need to come to class. Enough said. Great Guy.Much more interesting lectures than I got in Econ 102.  Lectures explain the readings, so go to class (it&#39;ll help your grade a lot).  Fair tests, but not exceptionally easy. TA&#39;s vary, so section can be very helpful or awfulI took this class last spring. I attended a total of 6 lectures and one section. I failed the midterm, and I am certain that I failed the final.  I managed an 80ish average on the homework, and ended up with a C+ in the class.  Schulze utilizes Kentucky Windage, and it WORKS.  I didn&#39;t learn a whole lot, but I got through it.Wissink is a great professor, but she gives difficult exams and can be a harsh grader. She gives you the option to waive a prelim if you have a conflict, which is tempting, but don&#39;t. I did, and my grade will suffer because of it (tricky final will be worth 55% of my final grade). Even so, I&#39;d recommend her class, as you get a lot out of it.","difficulty":2.4150943396,"rating":3.358490566},{"index":1999,"prof_name":"Jennifer Wissink","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"ECON1100","comment":"Practice prelims she posts are virtually identical to what the next prelim will be.

She provides a bunch of supplementary material to understand the material but that doesn&#39;t help if you don&#39;t understand the exam questions....Jennifer Wissink is a amazing teacher!!! The only problem is that I&#39;m now unsure whether I actually really love economics or if I just really liked her class!Very good prof. Understandable, friendly, interested that the class understands what&#39;s going on (both the subject and applicable current events). Can be a hassle that attendance is mandatory, but usually worth itWissink is a very hard professor to take for economics. The multiple choice questions on her tests are very tricky, and she is more math-oriented than other econ professors. She lectures very fast and seems to overcomplicate things.

Abowd was such a great teacher that when final exams cHis lectures are very intense and can range from 30-45 slides in one 50 Minute lecture.  He is a very good professor when it comes to making you learn the material, but he is more difficult than other professors teaching this course.not bad but you gotta study like crazyGreat Prof. Insane prelims, though he finally curved them and also curved the grade distribution (i.e. an 85= A-) b\/c people did so poorly on the prelims. He is understanding and more than willing to help out. Take advantage of his office hours, they are great. He is a true genius but doesn&#39;t understand not everyone else isDo not take this class if you do not have a background in economics. She is obviously very knowledgable about economics, but is not good at teaching the information. She goes through material very quickly and does not seem to worry about her students understanding the material. Her tests are long and she does not curve.Evan&#39;s is a great lecturer. He&#39;s very entertaining and always teaches exactly what you need to know. I never read the textbook and I did well. The homework problem sets are difficult, but if you understand them, you&#39;ll do fine on the exam. Go to a discussion section or some form of office hours if you have problems and you&#39;ll get an A.Tom is a great guy.  He is reasonable and very understanding.  Best professor I have had so far at Cornell!Very unclear lectures. Try to find a different prof for micro- she made everything more confusing.Sanders is a great professor everybody loves him. However go to his lectures and spend time actually learning the homework or you won&#39;t do well. The class is fairly easy if you put in the time. The office hours are great too. Discussions are pointless and very optional.Teach yourself, and don&#39;t be fooled by her practice tests.Hated every second. Worst explainer I&#39;ve ever seen it&#39;s like from one unit to the next the explanations got worse. If you&#39;re looking to actually gain a basic understanding in economics, save yourself the trouble. You won&#39;t learn and probably will have a hard time passing if you know nothing about the subject prior to the course.If you&#39;ve never taken Econ before DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. It is the worse. There are too many unrelated\/unecessary things that just take up time. The prelims are really hard and the class isn&#39;t very organized.

Her lectures are good, but you can do well by skipping both it and discussions and just reading the textbook, doing practice problems on her website, and going to office hours. Questions on the prelims are sometimes repeats.Wissink was good.  Not fantastic but very good.  Class is too big.  She&#39;s much better in smaller settings like when she did a group office hour before the final.  Go to lecture.  Then do her sample prelims and old posted problem sets. That&#39;s what I did and it worked great for me.  Does talk a bit too fast.Wissink is a solid lecturer and a nice person. Her lectures are all Powerpoint, but you have to go to class and take notes so you know what the graphs were showing, since she draws them by hand. Prelims are a little disorganized (e.g. not enough booklets), and the final was probably a little too hard. Like in all big classes, a good TA is key.The best professor and the best course I have ever had I have been crying for hours after taking his last lecture. Nick is really awesome! I even want to take ECON1110 again next semester. He is incredibly good at teaching and bring students warmth during such a crazy pandemic period. The homework is sometimes easy, but prelims are moderate.Prof Sanders is a really great guy! You can tell that he is passionate about economics and the well-being of his students. Piece of advice: make sure you study past prelims\/finals in order to do well on that year&#39;s exam. Definitely loved having him as a professor because of how engaging he was and how concisely he was able to explain concepts.Sanders is a great person to introduce you to econ but he does tend to run behind schedule so he gets a less thorough as the semesters go by. You don&#39;t really need to show up, the textbook is decent. My TA was terrible and so were a lot of others so don&#39;t bank on that. Do a couple of his past tests, his testing is quite different from the hw.Moves quickly through lecture slides and doesn&#39;t always explain the quantitative\/calculation parts, but is great for the most part. Posts the slides online so you can skip lecture if you want. Discussions were useless. HW is easy. Exams were straightforward and similar in structure to previous years&#39; exams. Nice guy, makes jokes during lecture.Overall, this class was one that shouldn&#39;t be hard. There are a ton of resources but I don&#39;t know many people who bother using them. She is a little disconnected from the student experience and will sometimes rush through material that is difficult and then move sluggishly through easy stuff. Overall, not badOverall a great teacher for intro econ. Her class organization is great. Her grading and tests are very fair. If you are having trouble talk to her and she will help you out. She really wants you to get a good grade. Lectures are useful so go to them even though she puts the slides up. Took for both micro\/macro. Although she covers material quickly, teaches it well, provides a TREMENDOUS amount of resources, and teaches it FULLY. Leaves no stone unturned. Also fair in grading. Best, shes kind and down-to-earth and provides plenty of office hours. Want to succeed? WORK HARD! Youll learn a ton. One of my favorite professors.Great professor. As long as you go to class and pay attention even though not required, exams are easy. Use previous exams he provides to study. He keeps lectures interesting alsoGreat lecturer. Makes class very interesting. Very accessible outside of class, with tons of extra office hours before prelims and finals. Not an easy class, but if you do the work, you can do well.Super funny, smart and engaging. Talks more about life application rather than theory.The course is well organized, and he has a great ability explaining economic ideas in an introductory class with crystal clarity. You need to be very meticulous with the prelims, as they&#39;re all multiple choice and a tiny mistake can cost you. Frank is sometimes a bit arrogant and engages in self-promotion, but after all, he&#39;s kind of a big deal.Wissink was nice, I didn&#39;t consider her a good lecturer but she really cared about her students. She gave so many extra credit work and her exams tested what she thought in class. Her grade boundaries were really lousy though. Overall, I would have gotten an A, if I had put some work into the course.Lectures are helpful but don&#39;t cover all material necessary for test. Do all the MEL quizzes and Panopto videos (because her lecture is usually fast paced) to make sure you know the material. It&#39;s easy to slack after a good prelim or two, but beware, the course gets harder as it proceedsWissink is really friendly and nice. Her lectures seem clear but when you go over the lecture slides, it&#39;s very hard to follow. Especially if you didn&#39;t actually go to lecture. The tests are NOT EASY. I&#39;m a junior, science major. Believe me. Everyone says micro is a joke but it&#39;s really not with Wissink.Absolutely terrible. Avoid her at all costs. You won&#39;t learn a thing. She teaches her course as if you&#39;re a graduate student, already experienced with the subject. And she&#39;s very rude, to boot.tests weren&#39;t too hard. just read the textbook and do practice problems. lectures are basically the textbook summed up. not a bad class overall.Good class.  Bad tests.  All multiple choice, no calculators allowed, and questions seemed to be designed simply to trick you into a wrong answer. Uses &#34;none of the above&#34; a lot which stinks.Very helpful. Just don&#39;t get too cocky and do all the MELs asap. Wissink is a little strange, but she&#39;s a decent teacher. Her lectures are pretty clear, the expectations for the prelims are reasonable, and they are absolutely fair if you&#39;re diligent about the homework and going to lecture. She says she doesn&#39;t curve but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true because I did pretty bad on the final but still got a good grade. I loved Econ 111 with Sanders. He made lectures exciting and interesting. There was a fair amount of HW, but he gave us three tries on each question so it was easy. Highly recommend Sanders!!Wissink&#39;s lectures are incredibly boring and hard to sit through. Her grading scheme is fair and very clear. Prelim 1 and 2 were fine, but the final was so hard. Overall it&#39;s not the hardest class, but definitely not my favorite. You don&#39;t really have to do much during the semester, but once the exams come, you start to realize how little you know.HW - multiple choice, 3 tries for every Q, easy 100% on HW. Lectures - quality slides, but sometimes skips calculation examples that could be helpful. Discussion - optional, not rly helpful. Exams - fair. Make you think, but easy Qs too. Grading - gives different % breakdown options and assigns the best one for u, this semester could drop a prelimSpeaks clearly, but lectures are very dry. She packs a lot of information into individual power point slides, which can be distracting a lot of the time. Tests are fair, homeworks are straightforward and not too time consuming.Basically solid.  Buying the text book was a waste of money.  If you go to lecture and use the slides she posts and sometimes the panopto videos that are there too you can figure it all out.  Not a fan of the MEL stuff.This class was at 9:05 in the morning but Wissink was always early and willing to chat with anyone who was there.  The slides were helpful but a bit sloppy when she wrote on them - but maybe that was because of her broken wrist. The practice work really helped a lot. Don&#39;t buy the text, just but into MEL cheapest option.I thought Wissink was great! Very well prepared. Tons of resources to use. She knows the stuff inside and out.Wissink is a boring lecturer and does not explain concepts well. Her prelims follow quite closely to the practice prelims posted online. The Final, however, was completely unrelated and extremely difficult. The class is very math-heavy. Her final curve worked wonders for me though, I failed every exam and still passed the class.This is class is not very hard, and not very math heavy either. If you go to lectures and section you&#39;ll be fine. I personally found the material to be very manageable and I&#39;m not an econ\/math person.She uses terrible examples for what she talks about. She rushes through lectures and her example pictures often leaving seconds for you to figure out what she just drew on the graph. I clicker points are important in each lecture. As well as the online quizes which are nothing like the class but important. Prelims are hard, but not the worst.Had her for 1110 and 1120. Lectures are not terribly interesting but they cover most of what is on the exam. Homework is easy points so don&#39;t miss out. Also offers iclicker extra-credit. Textbook is useful for reviewing info but not terribly necessary. Be sure to do the practice tests and psets before the exam.she is the absolute worst.... her lectures make zero sense and does not curve her exams (which are horribly written), I still have no idea what microeconomics isShe&#39;s extremely caring, helpful, friendly, and talkative. One of the more engaging lecturers I&#39;ve had. Class is easy if you&#39;re logical; I rarely went to lecture, never went to discussion, never went to OH, never touched the textbook. I learned by taking the quizzes and occasionally reviewing slides (avg 1-2 hours of work a week).Prof Wissink&#39;s lectures might not be it, but she really cares for her students and she is accessible outside lecture so that you can easily ask questions. She gives good examples and plenty of resources, making her class easy even if you don&#39;t go. Material is posted online, including slides, and recorded lectures on Panopto. Go to class -&gt; PassLots of office hours and optional study material. Didn&#39;t need to pay attention much to lectures, some were pretty boring. Life hack: ACDC Econ on youtube &gt; playlists &gt; micro &gt; units 1&amp;2 for midtern, 3&amp;4 for final. Grade based on midterm, final, and quizzes (hard not to get perfect on quiz portion)Professor Wissink was okay. Lectures were a bit disorganized and fast paced, overall weren&#39;t very helpful. The material itself isn&#39;t very hard though and there were better outside resources. If you put in the effort to learn the material, a fairly easy class.Wouldn&#39;t recommend taking her class online without prior micro experience. Lectures don&#39;t translate well to the exams and exams are difficult. The final was especially hard.Wissink is a nice person and means well, but she isn&#39;t a very good professor. She is extremely boring, and her lectures feel like death. The exams are hard, and include material that was glossed over. The final is ridiculous because a 1\/4 of it is analogies that make 0 sense.Easily the best lecturer I have ever had. You can watch the recorded lectures later so attendance isn&#39;t necessary but if you do not watch the lectures you will not pass the class. The tests are fairly simple and very straightforward and he provides plenty of practice prelims. The homework is easy but of no help on the tests. Textbook is useless.ECON 1110 had a light workload. Only attended a couple of lectures all semester and still had a solid grasp of the course material. The exams were similar to previous years so you knew what to expect. The required homework was not helpful to prepare. Median was a B+ but if you have any background in economics it is a stress-free and easy class.Such a passionate professor and really cares about his students. Lectures were really clear and he spends a lot of time explaining concepts and graphs. DO THE PRACTICE PRELIMS, though. The questions are extremely similar and the homework is often too easy to be that helpful. I honestly never read the textbook, just pay attention in class.Honestly avoid her if possible. I had never taken Econ until her class and unfortunately I came out without learning much. She made the material a lot more confusing than it needed to be and was very rude when I went to her office hours. She so puts trick questions on the exam. I ended up doing okay, but she was a very unfair professor.She is by Far the worst teacher at Cornell that I have ever experienced. She does not explain economics in a common sense way. If you already know econ then this class should be easy for you as she just mimics her practice tests. While she appears to be nice deep down she is actually quite rude in person.  Trust me dont take a class with her.Amazing class! Lectures are very engaging. I found the tests to be challenging but fair.her lectures are all on powerpoint and they don&#39;t make sense when you go through to read them over to study.  her tests range from easy to hard. she is hard to follow in lectures. learned everything in section.A fine man. I would love to take another class with him. Engaging. Funny. He made you think critically about economics.awesome econ professor....clear, accessible, and curves tremendouslyshe&#39;s very organized and posts all the powerpoints online. she also really wants her students to do well- she has multiple grading options and she puts a lot of quizzes online, that can bring your grade up.Don&#39;t even bother going to lectures, they&#39;re a waste of time and it&#39;s basically uselessProfessor Sanders is a great professor that has interesting real-world examples that make me look forward to class. His tests are very fair and make you learn the material. If you do the previous prelims and read the book you&#39;ll be fine, but I suggest showing up to the lectures to learn about the world.good professor. he tries to be really interesting so the material actually becomes more confusing (ik lol). He will provide examples for topics without providing a framework to apply that example onto. The textbook is a must if you have never taken econ. His tests are fair, but short, so you need to be very accurate to do well. Nice guy.Ignore all of the comments saying that Wissink is unorganized. All powerpoint notes are available beforehand. As she lectures, she fills in the powerpoint&#39;s empty graphs, charts, etc IN FRONT OF YOU. Then after class she uploads the &#34;completed&#34; notes. She does lots of examples. She is very clear. She has LOTS of practice prelims\/finals on her site.Very good class. Not sure what&#39;s up with some of the comments.  She was organized-very organized and very clear. Letter grades in the end were fair and higher than she led on. She might have let us know that so we wouldn&#39;t be so stressed.  Other than that, very good class.Fun class, fun topic.  I loved it but that doesn&#39;t mean the class was easy. Your TA will become your best friend  as the professor sometimes will be too busy to answer your questions. I loved my TAs and thought they were more lucid than professor.  Take the class, Wissink will force you to learn a lot but it will be fun.Very organized class. Web page is great and prof has a huge set of practice stuff available.  Liked the end material the best. Office hours were very helpful. Wissink rushes sometimes and talks too fast but was always prepared and really knows lots of stuff.Super easy class. I went to 2 lectures (I should have gone to more as he is a good lecturer), did not study for any of the prelims and did not go to my section a single time. I think if you just go to lectures and section and pay attention an A is pretty much guaranteed. I had two other friends who actually did the work and they both got A+&#39;sHard class. The tests were very hard, lots of hard questions. Do the MEL and get 100% and it will help overall grade. Great Econ base, but not an easy classNot a hard class, but not an easy A bc it is SUPER easy to underestimate it. HW takes 5 minutes &amp; isn&#39;t helpful for studying. I got a C+ on Prelim 1 bc I thought it&#39;d be like the HW and that messed up my final grade even tho I A+&#39;s on Prelim 2 &amp; the final. Focus on practice problems + lecture slides. Super nice guy, &amp; willing to help.Interesting and engaging lecturer who clearly is passionate about the material. Presents material in a clear, understandable way. First two thirds or so of the class the material was pretty easy; got difficult near the end. I especially appreciated that he had lots of extra office hours at convenient times prior to prelims and especially the final.Sanders is unbelievably dedicated to his job. His lectures have everything you need to know conceptually. His love for econ is contagious and his office hours are fantastic. Don&#39;t bother reading the textbook--use it as a supplement if needed. The class is not a lot of work but also not an easy A. Do lots of practice problems to study for prelims.Great prof. Really knows her stuff.  Love the before and after PowerPoint slides. Great class.Grading is pretty fair (both within tests and for semester altogether), but that&#39;s pretty much the only good thing I can say. Wissink will leave you confused, disinterested, regularly skipping lecture\/section, and cramming before prelims and the final. Take intro econ with another professor.Terrible lecturer; very unclear, moves too quickly, doctor handwriting so you cant review powerpoint slides at home. I dont even go to lecture: its a waste. Dont listen to positive reviews! econ is my favorite subject, but cant stand her. Prelims are tough because you dont learn anything in class so you have to study A LOT on your ownLectures are not helpful at all and confuse you more, you can learn a lot more by going to section or office hours. Just be prepared and know the practice prelims well!She is a wonderful person. She is nice, quirky, and fun. But she is a HORRIBLE lecturer.  I dread going to class because I know how confused I will be every day.  She gives a lot of practice problems that can only help you but what does that matter when you have no idea what the hell to do to begin with.  DO NOT TAKE HER! LOOK FOR ANYONE ELSE!Great Prof! Clear lectures. Odd sense of humor. Very helpful. Lays all the cards on the table for you. Loads of practice problems.Had her for Micro. Wonderful energy, horrible lecturer. Crammed slides, poor handwriting, &amp; rushing made things hard to grasph. I learned more in one section than in a month of lecture. She does offer help when you need it though, just not enough. I would NOT recommend Wissink.Great class. Very well organized. LOADS of materials to help. Great lectures. Maybe too long sometimes - always started right on time and ended late. Packed too much in maybe, but I really liked class and the slides.  Maybe could be a bit neater on her tablet thing.I was initially kind of excited to take this class and actually learn something relevant. She teaches at an EXTREMELY fast pace, and everything in lecture seems pointless in the real world. Had to switch to Pass\/Fail option in order to do ok in the class. People thought 1st prelim was easy, I found it to be difficult. Book is kinda helpfulWissink is very organized with her lecture notes and tries to be fair with her grading by providing multiple formulas to calculate a percentage. Lectures move pretty quickly, too quickly I think for an intro course. But she uses online questions to help boost your grade. Test questions mostly fair, sometimes hard. For the most part she&#39;s fineProf. Wissink is an excellent and enthusiastic lecturer who really cares about her students. She wants her students to have an appreciation for Economics but I have to admit that her class gives a bit too much detail for an intro class so I wouldn&#39;t recommended the class to non-majors. Burkhauser&#39;s class didn&#39;t even touch indifference curve maps...Tom is great guy. I thought he was funny and he always made the lectures interesting. Prelims were unreasonably hard, but the curve is generous. If you have to take introductory microeconomics, take it with him.Wissink lectures WAY too fast to really gain much in class. Unfortunately she requires i-clickers so attendance is mandatory. She often over complicates material. Most people I know dislike her class...and I have to agree it&#39;s not great. If you read the material and do the MEL you&#39;ll do okShe is known to be the professor Econ majors love and non-majors dislike. I&#39;m an econ major, however i didn&#39;t take Econ before her class. If you read the textbook, attend lecture and use your TA&#39;s its almost impossible to fail. She really makes an effort to have the class average acceptable. I loved her and I&#39;m taking Macro with her in the Spring.Taking Intro Micro with her is kind of a rite of passage, but she&#39;s not a good teacher. Lectures are much more confusing than they need to be. You will understand more going through the ppt later. Extremely easy to get all of the MEL points, you can probably average a 75 on every quiz. Try to do well on prelim 1 because final is mad hardShe is a really bad teacher. I never learned anything from her lectures. The TAs were no help either. I had to teach myself everything in order to attempt to even do moderately. The first prelim was easy. The second however was very hard. Do not have this teacher. You will be wasting your time it you do.Clear, willing to help students learn, gives extra sessions for struggling students, will address current economic conditions.My favorite professor so far at Cornell. Wissink expects you to put work into her class by preparing for lectures and learning from problem sets, if you do, you&#39;ll be able to follow her pace in lectures. If you&#39;re the type of student that always does readings before lecture you&#39;ll appreciate her efficiency and organizationThere&#39;s no doubt that she&#39;s very kind, helpful, and clear. The course was a bit difficult; not necessarily due to content, but because of the amount covered and the speed at which she lectured on it. Good option for those required to take the course, but there are better electives out there for those that don&#39;t.Great professor. Very clear in teaching and econ experiments and  practices in his class are generally fun and helpful for learning the material. He is very responsive to students as well, analyzing every student&#39;s test result dealing with problems individually. Exams are OKAY but you got to study. I recommend taking his intro class.Economics majors love her, everyone else doesn&#39;t. Her power points are wonderfully helpful and she posts them online. Overall, a great intro class.Wissink was an amazing experience for me at Cornell. The way she taught the class was perfect for a student like me. She was slow and gentle in explaining concepts. I was also very comfortable expressing myself during office hours which were usually empty and this helped my understanding(hence grade)tremendously!Thank You Prof! I learned so much.Easy class for an A. Go to class and you will be fine. Honestly, if you don&#39;t understand this class, you dont deserve to be a econ majorGoodShe&#39;s pretty easy in my opinion. Just go to lecture and make sure you do all the problem sets and sample prelims she has on her website. She reuses a lot of her multiple choice questions so her tests aren&#39;t really all that bad. If you go to her office hours, she&#39;s really helpful. And the MyEconLab weekly quizzes help boost up your grade as well.Teaches material in a harder way than necessary. Overall not such an easy class.Prof wissink is a brillaint professor. Given the 200+ class size that her intro classes regularly hit, she does a wonderful job covering quite a bit of ground. Grading is flexible and her presentations are clear and to the point . I would def recommend her .. anyone who is interested in econ ( major and non-majors) should look into her intro classPertaining to the distance learning version of this course. Problem sets enhanced understanding of the material. For the most part, lectures were clear, although textbook readings weren&#39;t optional for me. She responded to discussion board questions and emails very quickly.Do NOT take a class with this professor. She refuses to answer questions, especially if you take a class online.If you aren&#39;t interested in Econ, you won&#39;t be interested in her class. You don&#39;t have to go to lecture if you read the text book but either way it is going to be dry material. She&#39;s probably very good if you meet with her outside of class but in class it is just another fine, not great, lecture.I&#39;ve never seen a professor be more disrespectful to her students. When I went into her office hours, she belittled me in front of other students who were there for asking a question that &#34;I should know the answer to&#34;. Her lectures are boring, her online presence is unorganized (3 separate sites? really?), and isn&#39;t good at teaching the concepts.","difficulty":3.0212765957,"rating":3.8085106383},{"index":2003,"prof_name":"Bill Schulze","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"ECON112","comment":"No Comments","difficulty":3,"rating":4},{"index":2004,"prof_name":"Tom Evans","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"ECON1120","comment":"about 3\/4 of the grade was on two tests. multiple choice is not bad. short answer was really tough (even though you study) and comments on answers were unrelated, vague, and still confusing as to why you got it wrong. we didnt use the textbook. graded it tough, no extra credit. a ton of work and assignments, but it was barely 1\/4 of my grade.I. hated. this. class. He took an intro level course and turned to to something way too complicated. Little to no use of the textbook, and dont bother trying to study from it. Nearly the whole grade was based on two tests. Essay questions were super confusing and feedback was even worse. A lot of hard work but it didnt matter.I stopped attending lectures halfway through the semester cause I never paid enough attention to learn. I taught myself by reading the book\/lectures before exams (which your grade heavily relies on). Her Panopto videos are helpful. Let my guard down after the first exam (very easy) and did poorly on the second. Managed to get an A- (she curved).The class itself was pretty easy in general, just show up and pay attention in lectures and sections. Do the MEL quizzes and use iclickers for easy points. Prelims were extremely similar to practice prelims but the final was different. Wissink was awful at explaining concepts but there are many resources to help you.She gives her students a lot of resources and lectures well. The slides and past prelims are posted online, but not past finals. Tests are easy enough if you go to lecture and look over the material a day or two beforehand. She really tries to work with you with her grading scale, it&#39;s very forgiving.lectures go too fast, difficult to follow and take notes.Extremely easy class. I came in with no prior econ knowledge and was able to get an A+ with minimal work. Lectures weren&#39;t really that helpful but discussions were pretty good. The practice exams are exactly the same as the test.Decent class. Her lectures were kind of confusing to follow but overall she gets her points across. I recommend staying on top of the textbook because it outlines her lectures well. Very fair grader. Pretty good class overall.Her criterias are clear and she puts all the resources on her website. It&#39;s just her lectures and discussions are boring and they don&#39;t really help you with the prelims.If economics comes easy, this class will be a breeze. However, sometimes she is not so good at explaining tough concepts and you have to check the textbook to understand the material presented in lecture.She is super, super organized which is really helpful, but she goes pretty fast in class and can make the material harder than it needs to be. Overall though, I learned a lot from this class. However, even though I liked how she structured the class, her actual teaching was just ok.Easy to do well in her class if you do all the practice exams and problem sets (there are a ton) because she often repeats problems making her exams hard, but fair. Lectures are helpful and the ppts. are  available online to use for studying. Prof. Wissink is great, I am taking her again for 1110 next semester.Professor Wissink is a dedicated professor and I wish I could have her again and again.  She really likes teaching and cares about her students more so than other professors.  Negative comments here are likely due to poor performance or not have attended class which is their own fault.  Prof. Wissink comes highly recommended.Do the reading and you will do well. Tests can be difficult, but the class is curved in the end. Kyle is very intelligent, helpful, and down to earth. If you have to take Macro, I would take it with him.Prof. Wissink is a very experienced professor. Her lectures and notes are posted online. Her grading criteria is flexible, an easy A or A+. The class also has five grad TAs. Office hours were spread out throughout the week, very accessible. Avoid professor&#39;s office hours if you don&#39;t like being judged or hate criticism. She gets upset easily.Wissink is nice but shes an incredibly boring lecturer; my TA was cool and probably helped more.  Mostly I just studied on my own bc her lectures were so dry.  Tests are easy if you study the practice exams she has posted.  If you took macro in hs, it should be easy, otherwise it will be really hard.Terrible during lecture because everything will lead to her going off on an unrelated tangent usually about her personal life. TAs are very disorganized and the sections are quite off putting. Does post helpful practice prelims but overall pointless to attend lecture besides for the iclicker participation.Lectures move extremely fast and are deathly boring.  Does a bad job explaining concepts. Very math-heavy.Phenomenal professor, I don&#39;t understand the bad reviews. Incredibly clear, fun to listen to and just a nice person--willing to help in any way possible. I&#39;ve heard Micro is harder with her than Macro, but I have absolutely no complaints whatsoever. Take a class with her.Wissink&#39;s lectures weren&#39;t the most entertaining, but they were very informative. If you attend all the lectures, there&#39;s not that much need to use the textbook. Her prelims were very similar to the practice ones and the Panopto videos were helpful if you ever skip lecture.So boring.Tries her best to CONFUSE her students. Goes on about irrelevant details but when it comes time to learn the important things, speeds up and leaves students confused. Ohours help but are by no means amazing. iClicker attendance (optional) used for extra credit, which is a huge help considering she isn&#39;t the best! Tests are just like practice exams!As a whole, awesome professor, very intelligble about Economics, very helpful during office hours. The lectures kinda get boring and very early in the day as well. all the prelims follow her old ones The text is kinda uselessWissink isn&#39;t a bad professor despite what 1110&#39;ers have posted. It should be noted that 1110 has had lower means for fall 2010 prelims than 1120 (my class), but I digress. Wissink challenges her students, but her lecture material does appear on prelims. Those, along with the textbook and practice questions should be enough for a decent student.Do. Not. Take. Wissink.   Going to lecture is a complete waste of time as everything she attempts to explain comes out 100 times more confusing. Tests are Not Easy.\n Did not enjoy this class at ALLL, compared to my AEM fin acct. and Intermediate Micro classes this Intro Macro class with Wissink was the Hardest to do well in. Wissink is terrible.Great class. Wissink was really good and made it easy to do well if you kept up with the plan of the class. Do the MEL, it&#39;s worth getting the easy 100 on that part of the grading plan.Professor Kyle might be the best professor on the Cornell Campus. Lots of impressing experience combined with humor and academical honesty. He\u00b4s lectures are 100% easy to follow if you just listen to what he says. Tests are pretty easy and he follows the textbook chapter to chapter so its easy to look stuff up after class. Recommended course!I am conflicted about her hair.Fairly funny and does a good job appealing to a lot of people. The lectures can drag a bit but the tests are very easy.Prof Kyle does an excellent job of incorporating current events and issues into his lectures and exams. It makes the class both more interesting and relevant. I would recommend him to anyone. If you study and do the problem sets, you&#39;ll be fine.Tries to keep you engaged during lectures. My TA was probably the best one available and that helped a LOT. Do the past prelims and finals, they prep you quite well. The grading is fairly easy.I really couldn&#39;t ask for a better professor. He doesn&#39;t use notes or powerpoints when lecturing - doesn&#39;t need &#39;em. Regularly makes jokes, most of which aren&#39;t funny, but they keep you awake which is more important. He interacts with the class, not doing any Socratic method BS, but just asking easy questions to keep you active. Just awesome!Prof Kyle is a pretty good lecturer and is clearly enthusiastic about the material. He&#39;s willing to help you if you talk to him after class.  He could sometimes be unclear and hard to understand, and he got off-topic a little too much.  He&#39;s really into real-world applications of concepts, which makes the class somewhat challenging.Really nice and funny guy. His class isn&#39;t easy but he curves. You need to read the textbook to do well, and he requires you to read about 1 chapter for every class.Kyle hands out an agenda at the beginning of every class but rarely sticks with it. Lecture is solely him talking, no Powerpoint, and he can go off topic. In the end he winds up covering the most important things. Keep up with the textbook, do old exams online, and you&#39;ll be fine in the class.Teaching a class with nearly 300 people can be difficult, but not for Kyle. He has a booming voice &amp; personality and sort of reminds me of Santa Claus. He makes a lot of stupid economist jokes in lecture to keep people awake. Some are funny. This class is very easy if you just do the readings, which are not long. Section &amp; lecture are optional.Kyle is a great professor. His lectures are always engaging (he makes fun corny jokes too), and he is always willing to take questions. The tests are a bit challenging-but just go to lecture and do the readings and you should be fine.Very good at teaching, great class to take. She went way too fast in class and her exam questions were ridiculously hard. I felt like she would rather talk about nothing the whole time and be vague than be direct, which is really needed in Econ.How to Pass: Go to lecture for iClicker points Before doing the MELs, do the optional homework on the website to see the exact formatquestions. Do all the MELs. A week before the exams, she puts out 4 nearly identical exams from previous years. Do all of them. Take notes if you have to. She reuses questions and always has the exact same format.She sucks at teaching. I understand there&#39;s a lot to cover but she goes too fast she&#39;s been teaching for more than 20 years but seems like she hasn&#39;t figured out a way to better teach an intro macro class. went to lectures for iclicker. sections r more helpful than lectures. had to teach myself study hard for prelimsfinal. take other prof if u canGood intro professorHe&#39;s a great teacher and quite funny too. He always answers questions and makes the material seem not too difficult.Had Wissink for both micro and macro. She grades fairly, allows you to miss a few classes with lenient participation and is extremely helpful in office hours. She convinced me to choose Economics as my major.Wissink is a poor lecturer and a poor teacher overall. Lectures are boring and she moves too quickly through the material. The first prelim is identical to the practice prelims she has on her website. BUT the final and prelim #2 for both Macros and Micro are MUCH MORE DIFFICULT and will bring your grade down.Dr. Wissink is smart but not a good instructor. Her lectures are unclear, and she moves too quickly through the material. I had to spend way too much time outside class to teach myself the material. She is helpful in Office hours, though, so go to them! (I went a LOT.) If you do the work, however, you will learn a TON, as she does challenge you.She was one of the worst professors I&#39;ve ever had at Cornell. There are some terrible ones, but not nearly as awful as her. She is very passionate about economics but she does not know how to teach at a normal pace for students to comprehend. Do not take this course, I do not know a single person who liked it, take another professor&#39;s section.Honestly, she&#39;s not really a great professor. She does overcomplicate macroeconomics by trying to make it extremely math focused. Additionally, her textbook is absolutely useless, TAs are generally impossible to understand and she is surprisingly rude in office hours. Maybe she&#39;s better for micro, but for macro, she was terrible.Macroeconomics is an interesting and relevant class, but Dr. Wissink does an awful job teaching it. I think that it may just be the school&#39;s motto to not do a good job teaching students so that they learn it on their own, but Dr. Wissink especially fulfills that motto. I taught much of the course to myself. Take it with someone else if possible!This is the only review that I have ever done, and I am doing it because Wissink is HORRIBLE. Do not take her. EVER. She is an awful lecturer who moves way too quickly because she has premade notes that she simply recopies onto her slides. The point is DONT TAKE HER. hard prelims, awful lectures (i have her for both macro and micro, please listenGood Professor, she is very interesting and is passionate about the subject. Two ways of grading which can help students. Attendance is not mandatory but it helps your grade. If you want an A, study previous exams, do the MEL online quizzes, and attend the lectures!I really liked this class and wissink.Great Professor. Crystal Clear in presentation and explains concepts and computation steps really well. Homeworks are easy (just a little bit time-consuming), and you just need to complete most of them to get a full score on this part. Prelims and Finals are okay. Expect to get an A for the class.Great professor, class was easy and I learned a lotMassive class but he&#39;s a great prof and pretty accessible. Lets you choose grading criteria, and it can be just prelims and final if you want (which is dope, especially since the tests are cake).arnab basu is literally the greatest man on this planet. one of the most qualified and successful professors at cornell, he is so smart. willing to work with students and genuinely wants everyone to understand his classEasiest class I&#39;ve taken at CornellSchulze is the man. He kept lectures interesting and didn&#39;t require too much reading of the textbook. He does rant a bit, but go to section, do the MyEconLab problems, and try to do well enough to utilize Kentucky Windage and you&#39;re golden in his class.Great professor. Interesting class. Fair exams. The professor is very helpful outside of class and tries his best to give you a good grade.He seems nice and smart, but his lectures are quite boring and his accent is hard to understand. However, as mentioned in previous comments, he gives multiple grade criteria which is AWESOMEVery solid professor. Posts every previous exam online and tells you exactly what will be on the exams. Provides different grading criteria based on what will be most beneficial for you. Not a very interesting course, but worth taking nonetheless.Prof Wissink is outstanding.  Her lectures are entertaining and informative, she really brings the material to life.  She is also very approachable, if you have a question she goes out of her way to help you.  She is really one of the best professors in Econ at Cornell.Basu is amazinggood at teaching, extremely flexible grading criteria to get you the best grade possible, and a great guy. Tests are moderate and he pretty much tells you what will be on them. You don&#39;t have to do work or show up if you don&#39;t want to , but I would recommend doing it.Basu is the man. Great professor, you wont regret taking this class at all.Professor Wissink was a lovely professor, she clearly cared a lot about her students and was very engaging and enthusiastic in lectures. The exams were extremely fair, especially if you read the textbook and did well on the MEL quizzes which I found to be really helpful. Would definitely recommend!I took Micro w Thomas and Macro w Wissink, and I found Wissink&#39;s class + teaching style to be better. Office hours weren&#39;t that helpful, so go to a TA. She gives a ton of optional practice prelims which were super helpful. Her lectures aren&#39;t as bad as people say they are, and she&#39;s not mean. She can be condescending in office hours, so go to a TAWissink was a decent lecturer, went fast but covered all the material adequately. Although I definitely liked her teaching style, what held this class back a bit for me was the layout - three exams make up 88% of the overall grade, so it&#39;s very difficult to make up for one bad test.Good class, but I didn&#39;t really vibe with her teaching style and test set up. Making 3 exams make up almost all of your grade was stressful but it was what it was.Alexander is a nice and interesting person, but his teaching style is unfocused and confusing. His lectures are handwritten notes and unreadable, and many of the examples he gives are far more confusing than those provided in discussion. Tests are mostly fair but contain ambiguous short answers. Regularly goes on tangents that distract from class.Not a great professor- basically just reads off the slides and takes a long time to go over the material. I will say that this class was really easy though. I just caught up on all the slides before the prelim and took previous exams. The exams are EXACTLY the same. Some of the same Qs show up. Same format every year. Also is extra credit :)The lectures are a waste of time. The lectures have to do nothing with the prelims. The professor and TA are bad explaining questions. They understand what they are doing but there is a gap in the transfer of knowledge. The TAs don&#39;t know how to answer simple questions and Wissink&#39;s lectures don&#39;t help. Take any ECON class from another professor.A great teacher. Explains everything step-by-step and clearly. No homework, easy tests. Any student with respectable intelligence will get some form of an A in this class.Has probably taught econ too long to remember what it&#39;s like to be a learning student. She clearly knows her stuff and is an incredibly friendly professor, but sometimes she&#39;s not very clear in her teaching. The textbook helps.Not a good lecturer. She speaks ridiculously fast, then if you try to go back and review her powerpoint slides after not having absorbed anything from lecture, you find you can&#39;t read them because it&#39;s all scribbled! Can&#39;t judge the difficulty of the exams because I never learned anything.Confusing lecturer, though its obvious she&#39;s passionate about economicsBoring class, I only attended 5 or 6 lectures all semester and did just fine by watching the panopto recordings. You can get an A by doing the MEL quizzes (which are long but very easy) and studying from past papers - the questions in prelims and the final are mostly the same every year.Her lectures are clear. Just study past prelims then review them for the final and you&#39;ll be good.lectures can be somewhat scattered but she&#39;s an interesting person. the class is very fair, there are no surprises for your grade. just don&#39;t ignore\/put off your work for this class or your grade will dropI wouldn&#39;t recommend Wissink, especially if you&#39;re not great at Econ and need it for a requirement (like me). She doesn&#39;t explain things very well and lectures are confusing. Not many opportunities to raise your grade outside of exams. Online MyEconLab quizzes don&#39;t help much, take the practice exams to study.

This is way better to take than ECON 313.  Plus, the TA&#39;s grade pretty easy.Very dry. Methodical. Robotic, even.Wissink is very reasonable.  I thought she made her expectations very clear at the beginning of the semester and tested what she said was important in lecture.  Should have gotten a C+ but was bumped up to a B (probably for going to see her and the TA a few times).He makes a difficult, boring subject somewhat easier to handle. The examples are well thought out and makes a topic simpler to grasp.Easley is an awesome professor. Period. He is fair. He grades without a curve so the smartasses don&#39;t hurt your grade. He tells you exactly how hard the class will be from the start. He has realistic expectations. Lecture is mandatory, but never boring. He&#39;s good at giving an intuition for econ.Easley is a very capable professor and definitely knows what he&#39;s talking about. His lectures were good, although I still slept through\/missed a lot. But that&#39;s just me. Homeworks are doable and graded easily.

However, he manages to come up with interesing\/amusing examples to keep our attention.clear and precise, great lecture.The class is deceptive. Everyone seemed to get a lower grade than their grades warranted. Only take the class if you have to, because it kinda blows.This prof is pretty cool but his class is deceptive. It might seem easy at first but things just come like a torrent of information. Stay on top of your material you are almost guaranteed an B+\/A-. His lectures are pretty interesting.I admit that the course is well taught, but I suppose I just don&#39;t get economics.

Prepare to teach yourself Microeconomics. Not the caliber of instruction expected.One of the toughest but also most rewarding classes I&#39;ve taken at Cornell. By the end I had a rock solid understanding of the ins and outs of micro which prepared me well for macro and advanced electives. Lectures covered a lot of material so section with the TA is non-negotiable if you want to survive the tests.Majority of class dropped out. The exams were fair but the problem sets were atrocious. Only two questions (out of 4-6) in each PS (which takes 4+ hours to complete) are graded but never mentions which ones. Lectures and textbook are almost never enough to be able to complete PS thoroughly. Avoids answering questions in office hours. Steer clearOn every test we got an 8.5 x 11 inch cheat sheet front and back. If you miss a lecture you need to get notes from someone because the textbook isnt very helpful. Great professor. It was super clear what he expected from students on tests and he made tough material easy to understand.Professor McKee is one of the best professors in the Econ department.

He also really cares about teaching and uses different perspectives to engage the class. Definitely one of my favorite teachers. He made me love the econ major again and have some hope.

This might be because it was her first year teaching though. She&#39;s generally very helpful and as long as you understood the lecture slide deck, the problem sets were not too challenging.New professor. Not super comfortable in front of the class. Would constantly change her mind on statements of theorems when questioned. Extremely nice and willing to help if asked though.Nice teacher, but first year teaching. Understands concepts, but can&#39;t really teach students. She doesn&#39;t follow a book, so you have to go to lecture. A lot of students have trouble understanding. Would recommend taking other ECON3040.   Bottom line: she can&#39;t teach, but her tests are fair.Professor Huckfeldt teaches one of the most important Economics classes at Cornell and does so in the worst way possible. His lectures are interesting and easy enough to follow, but his exams are atrocious and do not test anything of relevance. Most of the class passes on a curve and come out having learned absolutely nothingHuckfeldt is not a good professor, to be blunt. Lectures are just him doing math on the board, leaving students confused. Tests are VERY difficult, and are different from P-sets. Unhelpful responses on Piazza. Take home message: some professors make life easier for their students by being clear, helpful, and reasonable. Huckfeldt is the opposite.Really focus on the powerpoint and the math behind the equations on the powerpoint. Every slide is fair game. Tests are relatively straightforward if you focus on the powerpoint and the math derivations he does in class.Reads straight off the slides he posts online. The material he teaches doesn&#39;t cover all of the content on exams as he expects you the supplement your knowledge with the textbook. Exams are 90% of your final grade. Overall- not a very pleasurable experience, but it you put in the work, you&#39;ll do fine.Tbh he is easily the worst teacher I have ever had here at Cornell.Extremely satisfying and encouraged me to choose my major. He doesn&#39;t skimp out on math and gives a solid understanding of several core macro models. If you feel shaky on your math, teach yourself how to use Lagrange multipliers and you&#39;ll be set. If you&#39;re genuinely interested in macroeconomics, Huckfeldt will not leave you feeling shortchanged.Funny\/entertaining lecturer but not the best teacher ever. Never uses the textbook. Don&#39;t really have to know the calculus because he doesn&#39;t ask questions that require it\/you only have to regurgitate the information. I believe he curves to a B or B+. Interactive class atmosphere in which he often calls people out.He is massively harder than the other professors that teach the same course. Doesn&#39;t teach but instead just does math on the board the entire lecture.As undergraduate economics courses go, intermediate macroeconomics may arguably be on the more challenging end. Still, while he was not always the clearest lecturer, Dr. Huckfeldt did a decent job in explaining the course material and its relevance to the field and economy as a whole. He was also very friendly and helpful during office hours.Someone with real talent at jokes and supplement materials, sometimes they will last through the whole lecture. His exams are straight forward but it does require you to do a lot of self studies, especially when he vanishes right after class. Overall a good experience.Barseghyan is hilarious. His lectures are full of jokes and references to Armenia. He is truly passionate about economics and tries to instil an interest in the students. However, he&#39;s not the strongest lecturer. He often just kinda paraphrases right through what you have to learn and ignores the syllabus. Never used the textbook except for hw. tough class, and professor huckfeldt wasn&#39;t the most clear professor I&#39;ve ever had, difficult to know what exactly the key ideas are in some of the lectures. very difficult exams. Great lecturer, makes the material easy to learn through powerpointsin-depth lectures. Easy to get at least an A- if you have a tough semester, easy A if you have more time. Dont get the textbook its only used for a few problem sets. Oh and if you want to learn how to become a ForEx trader from a crazy Armenian then this is the course for you.Challenging, but I learned a lot. Great class. very niceThe professor is very nice and you can tell he truly loves teaching, so it&#39;s hard to complain because he definitely cares about his students. That said, this class was very disorganized. He would hop from one topic to the next and since he never used the textbook, I never knew how and where to study from. Good material, but all over the place.There&#39;s definitely a lot to say about Professor Huckfeldt. For someone not interested with the mathematics of economics, I can see why his course is a lot. He could do a better job giving students the mathematical tools he uses to solve his problems. However, he is one of the most amusing professors I have had to date. I really enjoyed his class.Nice but relatively new -- slides still had some errors, but she corrected them in class. Does a pretty good job explaining in lecture. Discussion helps too.   Practice prelim\/finals from previous semesters weren&#39;t very exemplary of the actual prelims\/final, especially the 2014 ones.   HW was easy (1-2 hrs\/pset). Tests were easy, uncurved.Don&#39;t be fooled by Professor Huckfeldt&#39;s charming exterior. He will make you laugh in class but then writes exams that will make you cry. His tests are border line irrelevant, and barely include course material. In short, if you can take this class with another professor you should.Dont do it. At least not 3040... The class is just very unclear as to what you have to study and review specifically in order to be successful. I LOVE HENRY WAN CAN&#39;T WAIT TO TAKE MORE CLASSES TAUGHT BY HIM!!Accent is thick and he is old, which make it extremely hard to comprehend lectures. Gives quizzes, but tells you beforehand so you can study. Never clarified prelim\/final weightage.

The lectures and homework are unrelated, no one goes to lecture because they are hard to follow and do not help with the homework, all exams come from homework from the textbook, and we only got two exams: midterm and final. If I could go back in time, I would definitely switch from this class.VERY amazing professor, hands down the best. He makes courses interesting and often interjects with an anecdote or stock advice to keep up entertained. I learned a lot from him! He is lenient on the homeworks and would definitely accommodate you if you have difficulties meeting deadlines. Also the tests are easier than the homework!This is a straight forward statistics class. It&#39;s not a big deal if you have never taken stats because the only thing you need to prep for the exams is the lecture slides and homework. Going to class isn&#39;t that important but he gives funny stories and is very accommodating. Have to study even if the tests are open everything. Take 3110 with him.Tom Diciccio is the best stats prof you&#39;ll find. Lectures are dense but he does his best to make dull material interesting and often pauses lecture for a &#34;break&#34; in which he&#39;ll tell stories about his past or explain the importance of investing in your future (get that roth IRA!). Extremely helpful in office hours, class is curved heavily also.RUN. His first semester teaching this course, and when talking to friends who took it with the other prof they are horrified by the difficulty of what we are doing. Majority of the class is hopelessly lost. Did not provide enough practice materials like a practice exam for the midterm. People keep dropping.Kevin cares for his students, but is an awful professor. He is overly wordy with is explanations and is helplessly unclear. I took this class in S21 and learnt nothing from the live lectures because he is very hard to follow. I sat in the class lost every Mon&amp;Wed, was lost doing the homeworks and failed weekly quizzes regularly. DO NOT TAKE W HIM.Best professor at Cornell! He is truly always there for his students and wants to see every single one succeed! His office hours are also helpful for the homework!His slides are very dense material-wise but the class isn&#39;t difficult at all. Never took stats before and did fine. Homework is an easy 100%, attendance at section is unnecessary. Tests are long w\/ a lot of questions but open everything. Diciccio is good at explaining things if you go to class and pay attention and tries to keep things interesting.Being statistics, classes can get a bit dull at times, but Diciccio tries to make it more bearable by joining around a little. He is really helpful in his office hours, and is extremely approachable. His lecture notes are really useful, and in addition to the Webassign homeworks, are more than enough preparation for the exams.Wells is a smart guy and loves stats...he is really bad at relaying any of his information in a meaningful way resulting in very boring lectures. Having said that, the tests could not be easier; nothing he says in lecture shows up on the test and only the most easy fundamental concepts are tested. Great guy, easy grader, not the best teacher.Horrible. Lectures do not help with anything (homeworks or exams). Basically, he is a terrible professor and does not help students understand content for exams at alltom isn&#39;t super into teaching in general but will be helpful if u reach out. homework can get really annoying cuz they sometimes don&#39;t really have anything to do with the lecture material but he makes the exams fit perfectly with the lecture slides which he makes available. discussion completely unncessary if u can do hw aloneBest professor ever. Nice guy who genuinely cares about his students. Also tells great stories to keep lecture interestingProf. DiCiccio is a super nice guy, very approachable, really wants you to succeed. The webassign HW&#39;s are kind of a pain but a guaranteed 100. Both the mid term and the final were open notes, open book. The class avg was not good but he curves to an A- I believe.

He is passionate about teachingIt took me time to get used to Professor McKee&#39;s interactive style of teaching, but once I did, I really enjoyed the class. Professor McKee truly cares about making sure students are thinking about the material in relation to the world they are living in. Go to office hours, they&#39;re really helpful.Started out boring (I mean it is econometrics), but then he got into the  application of the statistics and was an amazing professor. You can pass without going to the lectures, but I highly recommend going to them because they help a lot and he makes the subject a lot more interesting!Really approachable and nice professor. I put off taking this class on purpose because this class is one of the most rigorous classes one takes in the Economics major. I was fortunate enough to have this professor. Although problem sets are long, he is a great lecturer and as long as you pay attention in class he explains the material well.The course was very challenging, but I think in the end all the work was worth it. It teaches a ton of data analysis skills.The professor was overall well prepared and approachable. The data exercises were interesting and turned out to be very useful for my summer internship. So, overall I am satisfied.I had put off taking this course because I was really scared but McKee is very sweet and patient. He actually cares about teaching-even has a whole podcast and blog about it. If you go to lecture and try your best to do the p-sets and actually are able to solve them before exams you can do really well. He&#39;s very helpful during office hours too.It depends. If you are a normal human, avoid him.Berry is a good teacher, econometrics is just a really tough class. Make sure you do well on the HWs from the beginning, as there are only 6 and they&#39;re worth 25%. Definitely do them with a group. Tests are generally pretty fairpredictable but challenging. Lecture is dry but just because of the heavy notation. He is nice and approachable.AVOID him at all costs. He gave the &#34;option&#34; of starting the final an hour earlier with a super long exam that you would&#39;t even be able to finish in 4 hours, not to mention that it was not fair for those who chose to show up on time. Questions were tricky and LONG. He didn&#39;t provide practice exams and lectures were pointless.Worst class I&#39;ve taken. Condescending and very disrespectful. He literally makes students chant after him and says things like &#34;good job, you guys finally reached grade school&#34; He says he makes us do this to engage in &#34;educational scaffolding&#34; but anyone with a brain will know that he&#39;s just doing it for the sense of control. tldr:Napoleon ComplexJakubson is by far the least caring professor I have ever\/will ever interact with at Cornell. He is extremely passive aggressive to students for no reason. I have reached out to him a few times with professional emails asking simple questions about the course of study for econ, and each time he has responded extremely rudely. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!!Completely mishandled online classes. Expects students to attend online lectures but spends the first 20 minutes nagging and down-talking to students. He has a large temper and has a habit of getting upset with students during lecture. Lectures are rambly and unfocused, may be due to unfamiliarity with online format, but still bad for the student.He&#39;s a really funny and interesting lecturer. Examples given in lecture are very good and help students understand the materialThis class is a straight up disaster. Tests are much harder than the hw. I think I finished 2\/3 of the final. He is difficult to deal with in class or in OH and gets mad when the prelim average is a 50. I would recommend avoiding him at all costs and take 3120 w\/ someone elseWhile a very brilliant man (he mentions maybe 20 times during the year that he went to MIT), his lectures are confusing and often don&#39;t present the material in the best way to learn it for the first time. Makes the class a lot harder than its needs to be, and arbitrarily curves your final grade without clear idea of how that process occurs.WORST class I&#39;ve taken at Cornell. Hands down. Purposely long and hard problem sets that no one could solve. Just resulted in students writing stuff down they didn&#39;t even understand.  Each problem set was painful, even after going to lectures and discussions. This class killed my major and cumulative GPA all on its own.Boring lectures; I learned mostly by doing the psets with friends. Econometrics is hard in general, but the math is pretty straightforward if you put in the work. Definitely recommend having a group to work on psets with, otherwise it&#39;s kind of hard to figure out all the concepts.This was the worst class I&#39;ve taken at Cornell by far. The material is inherently more difficult and mathematical than any course in the Econ major but Professor Jacobson makes life harder than it needs to be. He flips if you whisper to a friend next to you or fall asleep for a second. Very demanding and has absurdly high expectations for students.","difficulty":4.1739130435,"rating":3.1739130435},{"index":2028,"prof_name":"Claire Lim","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"ECON3125","comment":"I took the Applied Econometrics course last semester and really enjoyed it. The models the professor used and the example applications she gave were very interesting and relevant to what I want to do in the future. Now, I am working for a think tank and really seeing the value of what I learned in the course. Thank you, professor!Totally terrible. Her lectures are just slides from the textbook (and no, its not her who wrote the textbook), no sense of how to make complicated concepts easier to understand and despite the name of the course (Intro to Stats and Econometrics) the teaching is not on &#34;intro&#34;-level at all. And yes, her English is sometimes understand.The course material is very practical. And, the professor also gives good grades.The professor teaches a lot very practical stuff pretty well.

A good mixture of rigorous mathematical concepts and practical data exercises.I like her lectures so much, so I would want to take any courses she teaches.

Going to class and taking her notes is more important than using the textbook.Very good lecturer. Exams were VERY difficult. Class was curved in such a way that it was almost impossible to get above B+This class is hard but really worthwhile. Wissink really knows her stuff but talks super fast, so I recommend that you buy take-note just to have your notes as well as more detailed notes. Textbook not as important as lecture. (Go to lecture!) Oh, and look at her sample practice problems from diff years + sample prelims, it helps with the hw\/tests.This class confirmed being an econ major. Wissink is a perfect lecture, good proportion of examples to theory. If you go to lectures, you will never find surprises on exams or psets. Also, she and her TA are both so accesible. This is the best class I&#39;ve taken at Cornell.Go Armenia!!No CommentsClear lecturer.  Moves very fast, though.Good lecturer.  However, She has no sympathy for students.  The mean on our first prelim was 64%, and she said we should have done better as a class and decided to curve to a C+.  Hello??? This isn&#39;t supposed to be a weed out class!Wissink definitely does a great job of teaching the 313 class.  She is very knowledgable about the material.  Although the class is quite difficult, you will learn a lot for taking it.Wissink is a really smart lady and a good lecturer. However she does talk fast, so you&#39;ve got to be quick to keep up with her. However if you want to really LEARN some economics, take her class. Highly recommended.Wissink is my favorite professor. She is humorous and full of wisdom. She is willing to do anything to help the students who really love economics. I&#39;m gonna take Econ 352 just because Wissink is gonna teach that class. If you&#39;re interested in any aspect of econ, feel free to borrow books from her.No CommentsGood lecturer, but the exams were hard.  Overall, I&#39;d recommend.  But she needs to cut her hair.Professor Wissink has been the best professor I have had since I&#39;ve been at Cornell! She is a very engaging lecturer with a great sense of humor, and although her exams can be tough, shes always more than willing to help you understand if you indicate that you don&#39;t.Wissink is awesome. If only more teachers here were like this. I really learned a lot in this class, but people that didn&#39;t take the class seriously or skipped lectures tended to have a bit of trouble... do the work and you&#39;ll enjoy it.Probably the best professor I&#39;ve had here at Cornell, though also one of the toughest.  The best part about her is that she knows the stuff she is teaching extremely well.  Lectures are done without slides, just straight out of her mind.great prof!The best Econ prof I&#39;ve had here yet. She explains things well and is (usually) interesting. Sometimes she gets sidetracked and starts talking about her family, but not too often, and it&#39;s always entertaining.She lets her mood swings interfere with her already sub-par teaching. She talks faster than a car salesman on the radio. She will argue with you, make ad hominem attacks and is overall catty and nasty in office hours.  She needs to cut her hair that hits you as she walks past you.I would rather sit through an hour of nails scraping a chalk board than endure another semester of Wissink--and I would probably learn just as much.  Wissink seems more concerned with making up for years of personal failure by demanding respect from students than actually engaging them in academia.I could not follow this guy at all during lecture. He didn&#39;t follow the book and he would change notation constantly. He also tended to ramble about macro theory. I really wish I had taken this course with Prof. Bar instead.The guy below me must be high. Falkson may at times ramble and be incomprehensible, but his office hours are so helpful! The course material I found, for the most part, to be pretty difficult, but he was patient enough to help me through the material.Puts energy into her lectures. Clear and articulate in explaining the concepts, but must quickly jot down notes because she uses the chalkboard. Tough but fair grader. Go to her office hours if you don&#39;t understand anything; she is very helpful and kind - may sometimes even offer cookies. A truely inspirational and caring professor.She makes you work for your grade but she&#39;s an awesome teacher!  You&#39;ll definitely learn something in her class.  She talks and talks and talks but she won&#39;t put you to sleep.

Intermediate Macro is very much intuitive, and there are only a couple models that really just require a basic feel for intermediate-level math. He uses bimmers and armenia in his examples, no work required outside of class, his lectures were hilarious to sit through, take his class.Be attentive during the lectures. She is really helpful in person. One of the best professors at Cornell ever!With the new changes to the department, He decided to make the class ridiculously hard. Handed out really easy psets and practice midterms only to give the class an extremely hard midterm (average was a C-). If you want to take this course, (1) you have to love theoretical math. If you don&#39;t, don&#39;t take the class. (2) memorize his lecture notes.Overall good teacher. Interesting lectures, relatively long homework (but nothing too bad), and pretty easy exams.Man knows his stuff and his lectures are alright, albeit boring. However, he gives very few things that determine grade (10% HW, 35% Midterm, 55% Final) so your grade may suffer. Also rarely shows up to office hours, so it&#39;s very hard to get help from him. Even making appointments doesn&#39;t help - he just forgets.Definitely the worst professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Lectures were scatterbrained and only covered basic concepts, while problem sets were difficult and exams were impossible to study for. The TA had no idea what was going on half the time. It&#39;s honestly worth pushing intermediate micro off for a year to avoid taking a class with Blume.Blume is a poor explainer of the concepts in class and then when the tests arrive they contain material you have never seen before. He neglects to inform the TA of anything that will be on tests so the review sessions are worthless at best. He hands out no syllabus and cites simpsons paradox when talking about grades (look it up).Very disorganized, teaching has nothing to do with the book, useless lectures.I&#39;ve had her for both Micro &amp; Macro courses and I&#39;ve found her to be the best ECON lecturer at Cornell. She was very nice, &amp; extremely helpful. She makes lectures worth going to. Exams are pretty fair. She does a great job of helping students relate to the material.Nice and approachable, but class was structured badly. Required attendance at 8am lectures, where a lot of the time was spent in silent breakout rooms. Exams were all multiple choice, which is horrible for a math-heavy course!!! Problem sets were laborious, but really helpful to learn material. Overall good prof, bad class.I believe it was her first semester teaching at Cornell, but it really showed. I am fairly positive non of the course material was her own and that she was using other professors&#39; material. Also, it&#39;s a large lecture hall with low lighting, and for some reason she only did examples on a dark chalkboard. I sat in row 3 and could barely see the work.Make sure you go to class. Lectures are extremely boring and make you want to go to sleep, but they&#39;re definitely important. Memorize the lecture notes if you want to do well. Do NOT only practice the HW problems because you will fail the midterm like half the class did (including me). Grading is left to the TAs, so can be rather harsh,Professor McKee is not only a fantastic teacher, but an awesome person. I had a bad first exam, but McKee was very easy to talk to and make sure my grade was not affected by one bad performance. When I had this meeting, I got to talk to Professor McKee as an equal and a counselor. He has been very successful; talk to him if you get the chance!She did a good job at explaining how to use the formulas, but she didn&#39;t explain the theory behind them very well. Expect a lot of simple computation and some short proofs, which aren&#39;t difficult compared to proofs from other classes, like CS 2800.This man is easily the best professor I&#39;ve had so far. He is a great lecturer, but more importantly he is super considerate and accommodating especially during a tough semester. Absolute goat, and this is coming from someone who took his 8am class.If you haven&#39;t taken the equivalent of Calc III or more, do not take this class. I mean it, just don&#39;t. Calc III material is &#34;introduced&#34; with one or two examples in a lecture, with the rest of the lecture relying upon that prerequisite knowledge. Also class only has a midterm and a final, so your grade is up in the air for the entire semester.","difficulty":3.5625,"rating":3.3125},{"index":2031,"prof_name":"Jennifer Wissink","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"ECON313ECON","comment":"Very organized and clear","difficulty":3,"rating":5},{"index":2032,"prof_name":"Levon Barseghyan","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"ECON314","comment":"great professor, so funny in lecture. doesn&#39;t try to trick students on prelims - he tells you exactly what will be on it. if you have to take 314, take it with him!He is hilarious!

Wouldn&#39;t be unheard of for him to use cans of beer or bananas as money in examples.He is halarious and if you HAVE to go through econ 314, take it with him.

I love when he says &#34;just chill&#34;Great lectures but seems somewhat... impatient at times. But still hilarious. Don&#39;t underestimate the tests just because they look short. I made the mistake of overconfidence and I paid.Funny guy and easy class, but he does not do a good job of explaining the material. Very interesting to listen to, but you wont understand the material from listening to him.TAKE IT!  Lecture&#39;s are worthwhile for but materials are posted online.  The &#34;esteemed professor&#34; is hilarious and his prelims\/finals are easy enough.  Practice prelims\/finals are provided and are very helpful, as are the review sessions before them.  Prof&#39;s commentary is particularly interesting on the $-making and social side.  Awesome class.Prof. Barseghyan makes the economic idea really stick in the students&#39; heads. 10 years down the road, I might forget everything else I&#39;ve learned in college, but I am sure stuff I learned in 314 will stay in my head.Funny teacher who makes class time interesting. But he does go over materials really quickly. You have to try hard to understand on the spot.who knows why he has class at 840?  pretty straight forward class and lecture, but his tests are pretty difficult and he uses them as a &#34;learning tool&#34;, meaning there are hard questions on them (hard meaning 1\/3 of the test is brand new).This is a difficult class, not because of the material, but because the professor has difficulty operating Power Point (how he insists to lecture), and often has extremely dry lectures.  Tests consist of only a few &#39;multiple guess&#39; questions, making it hard to show how well you know the material. His genius shines through in office hours, though!If you want to take Econ 314, choose his. He is by far the most interesting and helpful Econ prof. in Cornell. The course might require some work but, as long as you do the problem sets, you will be fine.Easy class.  4 homework assignments based on completeness and the tests are practically identical to the practice ones.  Good luck on the final!Levon is the man, simply put.  Brilliant professor with a great sense of humor.  Teaches economics from a practical and applied viewpoint - concepts first, models later.  Rational, unbiased views on politics and economic policy, which is a rare find.  Not afraid to speak his mind and tell it how it is.  Take the class, it&#39;s worth it.His jokes make lecture more entertaining, but he isn&#39;t as clear in his explanations as he could be.  Arrogant.great guy, dont take 314 with anyone else, theres no way you can do bad in this class!One of the best professors at the Econ department. He focus on understanding the concepts rather than just pure math like all other Professors. Many real life examples to help you understand true economics. Exams are bit tricky, study for it. TA is really awsome too. &#34;Ding Ding&#34;!I love you Levon and I&#39;ll never forget you.  He is the best Econ professor I&#39;ve ever had.  The other professor teaching this class was Zhu.   What a difference.  Levon is precise and exacting--he is at all times clear and original.  I&#39;ll never forget lecture 1 when he shocked the class.Levon rocks.  This is a class where you learn something about the real world.  I would strongly recommend to non-econ majors (like me) who want to learn a lot about econ without working too much.He&#39;s cool. But I&#39;ve got to add sth bad about him. cuz he has so many praise already.  He&#39;s so mean!!He uses the same exams all the time. And I wish his exam could be more reasonable. ummm, he loves banana, bimmer, dudes... He should be less arrogant though, and plz, respect textbooks more.After taking 314, Levon is probably my favorite professor at Cornell.  He makes the class interesting and I have actually recommended others to take the class SPECIFICALLY so they have him.  His discussions in lecture have been profound enough to influence my day-to-day consumption.Fun class and good lecturer.  Has right-wing bias (for me bad).  Fairly easy tests and grading.

He&#39;ll want you to learn the underlying theory of economics and arbitrage -- not just cram information in your head for a test. He&#39;s a little too infatuated with himself and it can come across during office hours or lecture. However, he teaches to median of the class.Clear lectures. Could be a little hard, but becomes much easier if you come with no pre conceived notions. He does a good job in presenting material in a concise useful way. Exams not the easiest, but not hard to score in if you study a reasonable amount.He was rather difficult to understand if you were not familiar with his accent. Stopped going to lecture after the first week, went to sections, and read the textbook. Not a lot of work for a 4 credit class and the curve was quite generous.This guy is hilarious! His tests were only on a relatively small part of what was taught in class. What he did do in class was talk a lot about arbitraging opportunities, and how to make money, and when to buy or sell our bananas or Beemers. Very good class, but he does have a tendency to move quickly through slides.As already mentioned, very dry lecturer. Tests were ALL analytical and somewhat partial.Lacked Math. HW was easy... For the class I just read the book. I dont recommend taking his classGood lecturer with a sense of humor. His lectures, though informative, usually have nothing to do with the actual textbook readings, so sometimes I wasn&#39;t quite sure of the points that he was trying to make. Manageable workload.Great class.  Levon is hilarious and he teaches you real world stuff which always keeps you interested.Professor Stoye will not be teaching undergrads post-Spring 2014 for a few years. He is extremely enthusiastic about econometrics and lectures relatively clearly. Very willing to answer questions. Exams can have trick questions but are fair if you have read the textbook and attended lecture. Emphasizes conceptual understanding.Professor Wan is difficult to understand in lecture but he&#39;s great at office hours. Attendence isn&#39;t mandatory. I went a few times but noticed that the lectures are usually half empty. I was really surprised when I showed up to the quizzes and found how many people didn&#39;t come to lectures. The tests are doable. Just read the book and you&#39;ll be fineShe writes everything on the board, so if you miss lectures, don&#39;t expect any slides to be uploaded on Blackboard. She is very helpful and friendly in office hours. Exams are super hard, but class is curved to a median B+.I found ECON3140 hard as it moves quick and works a lot with mathematical intuition (which I&#39;m not great with). But this is probably the most useful ECON class I&#39;ve taken. The professor presents the material really well in lectures. It was pretty brutal but I felt like I learned a lot.He&#39;s not a bad teacher and tries his best to help his students. On the flip side, he&#39;s also not the clearest lecturer and writes some annoying exams. The textbook is pretty much used for only homework and helps only a little with the tests. If one doesn&#39;t like wildcards, I would suggest taking intermediate macro with another teacher.Awful professor, lectures are useless, utterly incomprehensible. I did end up learning quite a lot, but only through the textbook, the textbook was written in part by Ben Bernanke and is an excellent resource. Lectures are useless, however, I did not attend a single one after the first couple weeks and I still got an A.Econometrics is not an easy class, but Stoye is definitely one of those professors that cares about teaching his students. To do well in the class, you have to read the book carefully - a task which is made a lot easier by the fact that Stoye is a very meticulous lecturer.

Her problems in class are far too complicated, and her exams are exactly like the practice ones.  All theory based and little practicality.  Don&#39;t expect much.I&#39;m not a big fan of Mollinari. First of all she&#39;s not that hot. Second of all she does overcomplicate things and make simple concepts too technical. The problem sets are difficult but manageable. This class has many math majors and some hard science majors too. If you&#39;re not naturally a math person, this class may be a struggle (it was for me).He is a genius. He will get a Nobel prize in Economics someday..  Strongly recommended!!!No CommentsLecture is horrible.  Because he uses the overhead projector he moves too fast and doesn&#39;t allow the class to digest the material.  It&#39;s better to not go to lecture. Would be okay if he tought strictly from the blackboard, no overhead.Terrible teacher.  Lecture is pointless and unclear.    Extremely boring.  Material often seems uselss. Problem sets can be very difficult, but the exams are much easier.  Avoid if possible.His lectures are simply atrocious. Powerpoint anyone?Nice guy, funny, bad Engrish but a good teacher.No CommentsI have to admit that I fell asleep several times in this class.

So if you try to listen to his lectures, do the homework on your own, and review his lecture notes, you&#39;ll do fine.Very nice, pleasant, and very dedicated. Exams are fair, and you know what to expect.. I respect her.Nicest professor ever. Very dedicated to her job. (The first prof. in history to substitute for her TA&#39;s officer hours.) Really enjoyed taking the course under her. Italian accent cracks me up. Be nice to her. She deserves it.The class is formulaic in that, if you really don&#39;t want to, you can get everything online.  Many students chose to do so, as his presentation is pretty boring. He knows his stuff, though, and the tests are very fair (they DO come straight from old tests\/hw probs).  A good prof - take the class with him over someone else.Really boring subject, but if you pay attention, you can do really well. Even if you don&#39;t, you can still get a good grade because of his ultra-generous curves. Really helpful (though not always punctual) for office hours, and good about granting HW extensions. Really funny too: has a lot of bizarre anecdotes and often mutters things about Prozac.I hated that this was a mandatory class.  The material will be useless to most people.  Not really a hard class, but it&#39;s all theory and could give some of you problems.  DiCiccio is a good guy though.Aside from the fact that the man can&#39;t teach, he didn&#39;t give me a final grade until 6 weeks into the next semester. In all of my years at Cornell, he has been my worst professor.His sense of humor keeps lectures bearable while he curves his tests so that everyone does well, even though the tests can be tough.This guy is awesome. His tests are really easy and his deadpan humor makes the class really enjoyable. All of the homework answers are given in section too. Plus he&#39;s very helpful during his office hours.

His lecture is kind of boring sometimes, but exams are easy!hong is a good guy and a good professor.  his style of presentation for such a mathematical class is a little different (powerpoint-esque) which is why he may get a bad rep.  but he explains the material well if you pay attention. review homework problems and examples in the lecture notes and you&#39;ll be fine for the exams.Great at helping with homework and discussing the subject matter during office hours.

Majority of class relied entirely on the TA feeding us the solutions to the problem sets. Exams similar to problem sets.I honestly do not understand why his rating is so low. Occasionally, his accent might get in the way.Most of the time, if you try to listen in class,it&#39;s not hard at all to understand. The bottom line is, he tries hard to get his point accross.One thing to point out, he is an extremely approachale professor if you reach out for help.He will help u.possible the worst lecturer i have ever seen.  impossible to understand.  lecture notes are online so class in not worthwhile.I dont know why so many people are complaining down there. I agree that his lectures are somehow boring and he has a bit heavy accent of Chinese. But he provides good lecture notes which we can do self-study, and he does make the exam quite simple.Definitely one of the top few professors in the Economics department! Although his accent is a bit heavy, you get used to it after a few classes if you&#39;re willing to listen. He&#39;s extremely clear with his explanations and writes very easy exams. However, he leaves too much in the hands of his TAs so grading turned out a bit harsh despite easy exams.I don&#39;t know what everyone is complaining about either. Professor Hong is very clear in his lectures, and teaches you everything you would ever need to know about the subject. He can be a bit boring because he has a tendency to over-explain, but I would rather he over-explain than under-explain. Overall the best professor I&#39;ve had at teaching.","difficulty":2.5714285714,"rating":3.5714285714},{"index":2036,"prof_name":"George Jakubson","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"ECON320","comment":"Publicly humiliates students in a semi-joking manner, causes permanent trauma and fear of the professor.","difficulty":5,"rating":1},{"index":2037,"prof_name":"George Jakubson","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"ECON3200","comment":"He always made himself appear to be very helpful, but I&#39;m not sure how helpful he really was.

By the end of the 2 1\/2 hours, I had finally arrived at the last 17-part question. Despite this, still not a bad class.I second the comments made by the previous commenter. The midterm was hard and the final was god-awful. The lectures were hard to follow and there was very little continuity from lecture to lecture. Not recommended.Class is nuts hard, Stoye lectures ad nauseum about incomprehensible theoretical concepts at the expense of both teaching the material and preparing you for his capricious tests. They guy does have great fashion sense thoughBasically taught as an applied course.  Disorganized lectures and a lot of jumping around in the textbook.  Still, Jakubson is a really nice guy and very smart; he always makes an effort to accommodate students.  Few homeworks; tests were really long.  Wish we had gone into the more technical side of concepts.  He doesn&#39;t like math.Great Professor, but materials on GMM and Extremum Estimators was so hard. The exam was really difficult but manageable if you understand and studied his notes!Econ 3200 is tough no matter who you take it with.  Stoye is knowledgeable.

Unfortunately, he doesn&#39;t convey the material particularly well and his tests are unreasonably difficult. He also was not particularly helpful and when I voiced a concern about the class he kind of blew up.not a bad lecturer, but unhelpful and arrogant.  thinks he&#39;s god&#39;s gift to statistics.  smirks a lot and is very short.cares about our learning, funny guyHorrible.  Lectures are incomprehensible. Related everything to &#34;the moon is made of cream cheese.&#34; Tested and assigned homework on SAS programming without a single mention or guide. Tests are wayyyyy too long for alloted time. Without exaggeration, the worst professor ever.Oki...econometrics is a hard subject to study..there will be people who wont understand it at all...and professor&#39;s teaching style can be arguable..BUT he George is very nice person, if you use his office hours, and he is THE easiest grader in economics department. And if metics make sense to you,...you will easily get A+ on this class..Jakubson = Satan. Anyone who says otherwise is an engineer crying tears of joy to have a break from their miserable engineering curriculum.What a pompous prick. His lectures are jumbled, he removes the projector sheets after 30 seconds, and the textbook is completely useless. His tests are marathons that are challenges to complete. It doesn\u2019t reward knowledge, but how fast you can work. In office hours he says u r either stupid or lazyGarbage.  Straight garbage.  Good luck.This man is the devil. He will do whatever he can to make your experience as harsh and terrible as possible. Do not take 321. It is worth it to take 319 and 320 just to not have to deal with Jakubson.The worst Econ professor I have ever had. He is arrogant, has an annoying lecture format, and makes his exams unreasonably long. He seems to know his stuff, but he has a really hard time passing any knowledge on to his students.worst professor, worst class, avoid at all costsAmazing prof who makes econometrics both interesting and clear. Her blackboard notes are very organized\/clear and she always uses fun examples in class to keep you awake. Prelims straightforward, too.This is the greatest professor in the econ department: her exams are reasonble if you do your work, her lectures are interesting and engaging, spiced with her great sense of humor.  She&#39;s very approachable.  I would take another class with this professor.Pretty tough class but she&#39;s a really good teacher.  Plus, she is hot.  Especially when she wears those boots.I agree with someone down there. This man is Satan. Every rumor you have heard is absolutely true. This man and this class are two of the WORST things about this school.The hardest class I ever took in Cornell...I can still remember the pain of the problem sets after 3+ years...Straight up awful.No CommentsThis class isn&#39;t that hard. If you do all your homework, review all the class handouts, and notes, then you&#39;ll be fine. She rocks!DON&#39;T BELIEVE THE LIES! Excellent, challenging Economics course - you learn a LOT. Professor Jakubson is super nice and super helpful, and rewards students for exceptional progress. Our TA, Jing Liu was absolutely awesome! HIGHLY RECOMMENDENDED COURSE!His lectures are clear, but the problem sets basically REQUIRE you to show up to every office hours for help.  Tests are exactly like the practice exam.SHE IS HOT. Aside from that, the class isn&#39;t as hard as people say. She moves at a fair pace and is quite amusing during lecture. And yes.. she is HOT.Understands that there&#39;s a reason you didn&#39;t take 319\/320. Only 6 PS, prelims EXACTLY like the practice one. Spends too much time on proofs, but as long as you understand application of material you&#39;re good.He is a great teacher and always helpful during office hours.  You just have to go to lecture and take advantage of office hours. Not easy, but you learn a lot.she is a nice lady who actually cares about you learning but i feel like she makes things more complicated than they need to be. can hilarious at times and my suffer a breakdown at some point. but give her a break she is nice and tries very hard. her tests are copies of the pre-lim and she is someone you can&#39;t be mad at.very helpful, and exams are very similar to problem sets. Difficult material and too many irrelevant proofs in classvery unhelpfulShe deserves a chili next to her name... cause she&#39;s definitely HOT!Econometics is hard, but if you go to class and pay attention you can get a good grade.

Tests require lots of formula memorization, not like homework. Interesting subject, I like the example problems but had to do most of the learning by myself.Professor Jakubson made econometrics as painless as possible. He posts solid practice prelims and made himself available every morning for office hours to help struggling students. He grades based on improvement so he won&#39;t kill your grade if you bomb one of the exams. His exams are typically very long though.He really wants to be the professor who gets you into statistics, but his glaring mental instability prevents him from achieving this.  His class is like a gauntlet, be ready to be verbally taunted and treated with zero tolerance if you make the slightly faux pas. Take at own riskHad him for summer. His notes in his lectures make you wonder why you copied them down in the first place when you review them, but then the magic appears when you go to his office hours because he does a WAY better job explaining than during class. Btw, do NOT do anything distracting such as and even asking your TA a question, or you&#39;ll regret it.Great professor! Super helpful, one of the nicest I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Makes econometrics as clear as possible!Worst professor I&#39;ve ever had. Avoid this guy if at all possible. He is the devil&#39;s reincarnate. You have been warned. That is all.Professor George was clear, engaging, and most of all cared about actually teaching econometrics to us in practical terms. He made himself available every day after class if you had any extra question. As long as you went to class, did the homework, and participated you should have no trouble getting an A. Great guy- really glad i look this class.If the Devil had a name it would be Jakubson. If you are looking for the worst professor in the world... congratulations you have found him. This guy is worse than death. I generally do well in all my courses but this class i blame it 130% on this guy&#39;s mediocre teaching skills. If you are taking this class prepare your souls.She is not helpful in any way.  If you have the chance, take Applied Econometrics with a different professorTook the course over the Summer.  Definitely a great professor.  Knew what he was teaching and used real world data for the course.  Just go to class, do what Jakubson tells you to do for hw, etc, and there should be no reason why any student cannot ace this course.I learned a lot in this course. The professor tends to put some difficult mathematical stuff in several parts, but she is eager to help students who fall behind. Overall, nice and thoughtful teacher. The material she prepares is also very organized and sophisticated, although somewhat technical. Overall a pleasant experience.It is a tough course. But, she is very helpful and approachable. Very organized and knowledgeable teacher.The material starts extremely easy, and gets difficult halfway through. Lecture is extremely long and boring, she can&#39;t pronounce some words. On top of that, the textbook is HORRIBLE. Take the class if you have a background in stats. Make sure you read and pay attention so you don&#39;t fall behind. HW and Exams are easy if you are caught up.Worst experience at Cornell. Heavy accent, speaks very quickly, doesn&#39;t explain jargon, and can&#39;t tell the difference between easy material (First month: what is a mean?) and hard material.  Tests\/HW not hard, but you have to learn material on your own. Every minute of lecture is torture, only half the class shows up.Her lecture is quite clear and in particular her lecture slides are helpful. However, she is not such an approachable person...Is not easy, although, if you do all the homeworks and keep notes in class it is totally do-able! Sessions are extremely important in order to pass the exams and completely understand. The material is great since all are real life\/applied cases and that gives the class a great point of view.possibly one of the more rewarding classes I&#39;ve taken yet. The material is CHALLENGING, but Molinari is extremely helpful and enthusiastic both in the class and in office hours (go to office hours, trust me) and if you put forth some effort, you will be rewarded. Molinari has a very loud italian voice, but she&#39;s hilarious.She&#39;s a great professor. She&#39;s definitely very.. opinionated, but it&#39;s entertaining and makes an otherwise dull class fun and interesting. She approaches the material very logically and gives you a good idea of what will be on each test well ahead of time, as well as providing problem sets that prepare you well.

Problem sets and exams focused on simple economic models for development concepts and stylized facts from empirical studies.The class is fine, if unexciting.  I like that he tries to teach people basic empirical methods.  My advice to Prof Berry:  Come to class on time.  When you consistently arrive to class 5+ minutes late, it signals to students that you&#39;re not interested in teaching and that&#39;s a turn off.  Overall, a decent, if unexciting class.

He&#39;s also a nice guy :DGreat class overall! The lectures have clear direction, and she is very passionate about economics which makes it easy to stay engaged. The subject material can be challenging but her tests are always very similar to the practice exams she posts so it&#39;s not hard to do well. Going to class definitely makes it easier to do well, but not mandatory.Professor Berry is great in the classroom. His lectures are clear and fun.

He&#39;s intelligent, approachable, and funny. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever left class without having laughed at least once.

Extremely accessible and happy to help during office hours. Class discussions were interesting and insightful. The material was made up of modern books, TV shows, movies, etc. that I really enjoyed delving into and talking about. Student participation valued. 11 out of 10.Prof. Robbins is a great teacher and makes it fun to analyze different badasses through literature and film. He&#39;s a pretty tough grader but his commentary is very clear and helpful and he&#39;s all about giving better grades are your writing gets better over the semester.  Overall, good class, great professor, and definitely worth takingDr. Green was such a nice and encouraging professor. Course demanded a decent amount of work, but grades are labor-based and not quality-based. Aka your grade is an actual reflection of how much effort you put in. Chose interesting books and he tried really hard to make the material interesting. Participation matters. Would recommend!Took FWS: Monsters in Fiction. Interesting class and class itself is also fun. The amount of reading assignment can be overwhelmed especially during prelim and final seasons.  But the books are interesting since it&#39;s related to monsters. Use the office hour, since she is very willing to help and give feedback. READ A BOOK AND PARTICIPATE.Lena is such an amazing teacher! The class is easy, organized, and SO interesting. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!Prof. Orr is super nice and knowledgeable. Despite his amazing educational and professional background (Princeton, Yale Law, New York Times), he is humble, listens to you, and stays after class however late if you have any questions. Course materials are carefully chosen. Totally recommend any class with him.Lena is great! I love her!He is so understanding with his students and so relatable at the same time. Class material was really eye opening. Thoroughly enjoyed any creative assignments. Guaranteed to love this class, even if the topic doesnt particularly interest you. 10\/10.Marty was so knowledgeable and made a subject that was foreign to many in my class relatable to our lives.

He openly facilitated an environment where you could really explore your ideas and share them in discussion. I really enjoyed this class and the ability I had to expand my writing skills in a way that I had not had a chance to before. Would totally recommend. Also light homework.Ive learned so much from this class. Ive liked reading and writing at a young age but at high school, English classes have been taught in a way that discourages that. Hand is caring and passionate about writing. Her class is a breath of fresh air. You will learn to become a much better writer in this class.Professor Mercier is a kind, understanding, easy-going person and is very flexible with deadline extensions. She gives extensive feedback on essays and grades in a unique way that mostly takes into account how you improve on draft feedback and over the course of the semester. The class has a reasonable amount of readings and are all interesting.She teaches her FWS: Short Stories VERY WELL. I am not even an English major but I would look forward to her class. Not because it was easy or you could sleep through it but because you feel like you can learn without major academic pressure. She ensures that if you put in enough work there isn&#39;t any need to worry about the class grade-wise.Great at constructive criticism, very interesting assignments.Ashley is one of the most caring profs at Cornell. Her prompts are broad, so you&#39;re really able to run with the assignments and do what you want with them to make it your best work. You&#39;ll get out of this class as much as you put into it.

A fun class overall with great discussions.The best lectures I&#39;ve ever had. ellis absolutely knows his field and can always articulate the matters very fluently and elegantly in the lecture. He gives very detailed feedback and might be a bit picky on the papers, which you probably won&#39;t get from other professors, but that is extremely helpful. also VERY willing to help.Ellis is a talented and engaging speaker. Material was always a joy to read and I looked forward to his discussions. As for grading, he makes you work for it. He can be intimidating at times, but he&#39;s mostly friendly, witty, and helpful. Did I mention he is hot as hell??????I entirely expected to hate this class considering it was an English FWS, but it turned out to be my favorite class the entire semester. Dr. Lears is very flexible with meeting and also when it comes to extensions. Criticism is very helpful and constructive. Highly recommend!Pros: Super approachable and knowledgeable professor who makes an effort to keep class interesting and gives specific feedback, not difficult to get a good grade if you put even a little effort into essays and talking in class Cons: A LOT of reading, class participation is important to your grade  Overall, a good class that did improve my writing!Convinced he talks just to hear himself speak, we didn&#39;t received a single grade until it was too late to revise or make an attempt for a better grade.I took this class freshman year as FWS, and I immediately dropped it. The time I was in it we spent in a circle just noting random facts about the book at hand and didn&#39;t get anywhere at all, plus it was ridiculously boring with no variance in activities whatsoever. Felt like I was back in 9th grade lit. Like the topic; don&#39;t like the professor.I love Professor Faulkner!! I had him freshman year for an FWS, and despite not being a strong writer, he was really open to working with me (and all of my other classmates) to make sure we got the help we needed to do well in his class. We seemed to write more essays than the other FWS&#39;s, but he constantly gave us opportunities to improve.Honestly this man is the best professor I could have ever asked for. He&#39;s super chill about everything, deadlines included, and he really does care about his students. He gives few grades so that you can focus on your writing instead of what grade you&#39;re going to get in the class, which I really appreciate. He&#39;s such a good man. 10\/10Very clear, engaging and nice. Class was lively: somehow everyone used to contribute(unlike my other FWS where like 2 people ever talk). My writing improved a lot!

VIRAMONTES IS AMAZING!I had this professor for my FWS: Question of Tragedy. The readings were very interesting, but the professor was incredibly disorganized. He was often late, would sometimes lose papers, and by the end of the semester we ran out of time to cover the material properly.

I just enjoyed listening to what he had to say about the different things that we&#39;d read in class. He&#39;s also a very kind and understanding person.Professor Saccamano is a pleasure to listen to in lectures. While the material can sometimes get quite dry, he makes up for this by his unique in depth analysis of the plays we read; we viewed them through religious, political, sexual, and various other fascinating lenses.

She&#39;s an engaging lecturer in a very bizarre way and unintentionally hilarious. I enjoyed her class, but it sometimes made me want to die. Regardless, she made boring rennaisance literature interesting, which is a tough thing to do.Fried is a really good lecturer, but this semester she slacked off.  The TA did most of the grading and handed papers back really late because he had so much to do.  The midterm was returned THE DAY BEFORE THE FINAL!!!  The class could have been good, but Fried&#39;s poor communication limited it.Kalas is a hard grader, and she destroyed any interest I had in medieval lit after taking her class-otherwise a nice woman.

Sometimes he can be a bit long winded and he is so intelligent that sometimes it&#39;s hard to follow his train of thought, but when you pay attention you can really get a lot from what he says.

He tends to ramble a bit, but his asides are usually very interesting. The essays and texts we read were great and assignments are graded fairly with extensive feedback. The final project is also awesome. Definitely take this class!Stuart is amazing!!! He tends to ramble but everything he says is brilliant, and his dry humor was the highlight of my day this semester!

His lectures are very scatter brained and his tests are very long. A cold man who could care less about his students. For the love of God and all that is holy, go to Petrina&#39;s lecture. It&#39;ll save your grade in the class.not good.terrible professor...has prejudice against some students... absolutely, *read my lips* absolutely NOT helpful at all, although he tells you to find him for help..hypocriticalVery irresponsible. Talks like a machinegun in class and doesn&#39;t care if you understand or not. I gave up and stopped going to lectures totally like 4wks into the sem. Learned more from the textbook than all his lectures!Absolutely awful- At first he seemed ok but ultimately he was terrible. Never explained the topics, only did example problems in class, during which he would make several mistakes and needed to be corrected by students.  This class was taught by him and one other guy, and his classes consistantly did worse on the quizzes and prelims than the other&#39;Class isnt overly difficult so can get boring at times.  He has a heavy accent but he works hard to try and overcome it.  Can be very funny at times... if your awake to hear it.  His in class quizzes are terribly run.PP is great,made coming to lecture fun. His corny jokes crack me up. I love how he randomly starts talking about his research or various inventions.Helpful, though he tends to not like going to OHours. However, he tells u to stop by his office any time if you need help, I,ve done so a few times and he&#39;s always willing to give up time.Healey is a great guy.  I went into this class with a lot of interest in the subject and came out with even greater interest.  He constatntly jokes and tells numerous &#34;back in my day..&#34; stories.  Very helpful in and out of the classroom.  He wants every student to understand what&#39;s going on.  Tests aren&#39;t bad as long as you do the homework.Little odd, but a very good professor, has mastery of subject.  Avoid using his textbooks, though.  Is willing to help you as much as he can.No CommentsWORST PROFESSOR EVER.  I repeat this cuz it&#39;s true.  WORST PROFESSOR EVER.  Don&#39;t take his courses at all costs.he&#39;s kinda cold in person but he knows how to teach. Well prepared and organized. 202 stuff is his specialtyNo CommentsGood teacher, but don&#39;t ask him for any favors. The class itself was on a difficult curve.117 and 202 - His lectures are quite repetitive, and he doesn&#39;t like to help out, but the class itself isn&#39;t overly hard.Petrina is one of my favorite professors in the engineering department.  He seems to care about his class, and is a genuinely nice guy (go to office hours).  I think he curved the class pretty high.  He&#39;s not the absolute best lecturer, but what he lacks in oral communication, he more than makes up for in visual depiction.  In short, Petrina rocks.He&#39;s a great teacher and seems to have a lot of experience in the field he teaches about.  It&#39;s worth it to attend lectures just to hear him get excited about all the money he makes from his creations.  And to hear him say &#39;equilibrium&#39; in his awesome accent every other second.Petru is the man!He was a funny guy, but a terrible teacher.  You can learn the material out of the book, but don&#39;t count on learning anything in his lectures.He makes careless mistakes on the board and pulls prelim problems out of a book instead of making his own. When I came to office hours, he actually solved the problem incorrectly for me. And for goodness&#39; sake, if the final is to be 2 hours instead of 2 and 1\/2, please tell us about it!His home-made text book should be burned and never be allowed to plague another student&#39;s life.  There&#39;s a reason no one&#39;s wanted to publish it yet, and he still gets it printed from kinkos.Good teacher. Interesting.Had him for MAE 212 and 202. Actually not that great at teaching. However, he is one of those professors you &#39;must have&#39; before graduating. The funniest prof I&#39;ve had. Petru is the man.He really cares about 202 students.  He has small handwriting.petru is cool. i love when he explains a prob, no matter how impossible it is, somehow the prob becomes freakin easy...i def learned a lot in his lecture. and! he actually does review for prelims\/final in his lecturefirst of all he pronounces theta like &#34;tee-tah.&#34;  also he sucks at life.  I can&#39;t stand to hear this man teach.  he&#39;s from rumania and can&#39;t speak english.  he&#39;s a very jolly man, which is cool and all, but he simply can&#39;t communicate in english.  not worth the tuition.  sorry petru, peace outGreat teacher!Okay class....boring at times.  he speaks with a heavy accent and sometimes it&#39;s hard to understand what he&#39;s trying to convey.  He&#39;s pretty funny at times and the prelims aren&#39;t bad.Petru cares a lot about actually helping kids to understand things, he&#39;s awesome.Nice, old man. Likes to give away answers sometimes, but tried to curb it at the end of the semester. A little unclear when speaking and teaching.Petru Petrina is the best professor I have so far.  He&#39;s funny and clear.  He also knows the material very well (in fact he doesn\u2019t really need notes to lecture).  He tries very hard to make sure everyone knows the material, and he spends a lot of time wiHe teaches relatively well.  Very knowledgable and most often times interesting and humorous.  Tries really hard to teach but sometimes hard to understand and read.interesting lecturer,cracks funny jokes during lectures,cares for students.Clear, organized lectures,definitely a contrast to the other 202 lecturer of 202","difficulty":2.5882352941,"rating":3.3823529412},{"index":2392,"prof_name":"Meredith Silberstein","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"ENGRD2020","comment":"She is so mean and rude and just an awful teacher. I would give her a negative rating.Professor Silberstein, while good intentioned, comes to class wildly unprepared for lecture. Would often do problems and realize (after students called her out) that she had done them completely wrong. I got through this class solely by reading the textbook and learning on my own. Not approachable, kind of mean.Ruina is probably one of the smartest guys I ever met and he definitely tries to help students (ie exam problem redos, dropping lowest grades, etc.). However, despite his good intentions a few things backfire (ie exam redos result in simply a higher mean with smaller deviations). I hated how he used a textbook he wrote that just echoed his lecture.Uncurved class.. mean on the final was a 62. Makes it incredibly hard to do well. Prof Silberstein succeeds in making an intuitive and interesting class for engineers into a complete nightmare.Textbook is not useful at all.  Lectures are fast and confusing, it almost seems as if he tries to confuse you on purpose.  It was hard for me to understand, esp since the textbook was so poor.  He def tries to be helpful though, and drops the lowest homeworks and prelim probs.Least favorite professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell. The class isn&#39;t that hard but she&#39;s not a good teacher and is especially unhelpful when you ask questions.Handwriting is messy and the lectures are disjointed. Lectures consisted mostly of her going through example problems without explaining how she was solving them. Silberstein is alright. The expectations for the course are pretty straightforward, and all the info you need to know for the homework and exams is in lecture. She doesn&#39;t curve the class, but the prelims weren&#39;t that bad and the averages were 83 or 84. The iClicker quizzes are the worst though, they&#39;re 20% of your grade which is insane.  Great professor. Always entertaining and willing to help. Accent is a little thick, but you get used ot it pretty quicklyPlease take this class with Sachse. Nothing else to say.My only complaint is that her handwriting is really bad and can sometimes make it hard to follow her notes. Otherwise, she is great and I enjoyed the classSo far my least favorite professor I&#39;ve had my three years here. Lectures were frustrating because her handwriting was messy and her hand always blocked her notes. She was extremely condescending at office hours and didn&#39;t even know how to solve the problems. Not helpful at all and only laughed\/scoffed at me when I would ask her for help.I had Professor Silberstein in Spring of 2016. Right from the get-go I knew that the class (statics) would be horrible, and by the end my initial impressions were confirmed. The grading policy was horrendous and is essential set up so that students are not successful. I wish ratemyprofessor had a rating lower than 1. I do not recommend her.She has an aggressive, condescending attitude towards students which makes her lectures very calculations-oriented rather than focused on introducing and explaining concepts to the class. So if you walk in 5 mins late, you&#39;ll see a bunch of numbers scrawled on the board and have no idea what they are. She mocks students for asking questions.2 different professors actually taught this course and I was unfortunate enough to have the other guy. Sachse  was a much better instructor and I frequently attended his lecture instead of my own. He goes very very fast in lecture but does great examples that are quite helpful. Overall a good guy but gets angry sometimes when questions are asked.worst professor i have had in my undergraduate career thus far. too bad i have to pass this class.Petru is amazing! He&#39;s my favorite professor. very knowledgeable in his field and very sweet and funny. He is definately on the student&#39;s side and lectures are good.Petrina is a great professor in general. If you dont mind his accent, you will like him. His gradings are objective and discussions are oftenly helpful. He wears same jeans and sweater everyday and it kina bothered me (dont know y) He is good and funny and I recommend you take his course (i guess u have to if u r a mechE or Civil)Course progresses slow but steady, hardest in the middle, fine teacher if a touch disorganized presentation of material. A bit too much homework for a relatively easy subject. Not too difficult to do well, tests were sometimes too long for the time given (which was extended to start with).The class isn&#39;t that hard, and you can probably get a good grade just by reading from the book. Two homework sets a week was quite annoying, and the lab was worthless; other than that, the class was pretty straightforward.I was wary of Statics, but Ritz was a fantastic professor who really made me interested in the material. The class is hard but not unmanageable if you put in the work - OH are very helpful! Lectures were above average and the exams were fair (although difficult). Homework sometimes seemed like a lot but the problems were worthwhile.Good lecturer for 2020. Maybe he&#39;s awful for his other classes, but this one was great. Pretty funny guy who explained the concepts well. Made several mistakes on the board, but that&#39;s par for the course. I found the exams very straightforward and contained exactly what you expected. I&#39;d take 2020 with him again.Decent professor. Online homeworks are very difficult. Homeworks are usually manageable. Exams are hard, but fairIncredibly off-putting personality, made me hate the subject from the very start of class. On top of this seems to assign work with some sort of vendetta in mind, intentionally confusing students with the mere selection of problems (not to mention the ridiculous format in which homework must be submitted) and then penalizing the confused class.Doesn&#39;t understand that there&#39;s a pandemic going on. Literally so frustrated and office hours were not helpful for this course at all. worst engineering class i&#39;ve ever taken.His lectures are a little fast-paced, but he keeps them pretty engaging. Reading the book before lecture is a must. The homeworks took an annoyingly long time. The exams and quizzes required a lot of practice in order to prepare, but are pretty fair. Overall, Sachse is good, but is probably a better teacher in higher-level courses.It&#39;s her first time teaching, and yes, you can tell. But I think that her lectures were all right, and the discussion classes were very helpful as well. I learned enough in lecture and discussion to be able to do the homework without much problem. I&#39;d say she&#39;s doing all right for her first time teaching.I had to drop this class with Ruina and retook it with Sachse, and he was so much better. Exams were fair, psets helped, and the textbook was clear. Definitely better than I expected.Sachse really is fairly decent - he does make a ton of mistakes, but his explanations are fairly clear if you keep up \/ read the book ahead of time. He&#39;s definitely better than average, and more than acceptable as a teacher. However, he makes the course very annoying - 2 psets a week are very annoying!Difficult teacher, but overall pretty decent. He&#39;s overall pretty clear, and a pretty interesting lecturer!Sachse really isn&#39;t as bad as many people think - he&#39;s decent at explaining, and fairly clear. However, he is very tough - 2 psets \/ week and he doesn&#39;t curve.First time she&#39;s ever taught a class. You can tell. She really doesn&#39;t seem to have any interest in helping her students do well and sometimes I feel like she actually wants to fail half the class. Her I-clicker questions and quizzes are useless.Silberstein is an alright Prof. she teaches the material that&#39;s on her tests, and her tests aren&#39;t that hard. Annoying laugh though.Agreed. If this is not a requirement course for you, DO NOT TAKE IT. I&#39;ve had my fair share of good\/bad professors but she is definitely the worst I&#39;ve had. Lectures are one of the most boring and unorganized I&#39;ve ever seen (very few pp slides, almost all handwritten notes)Just run. She might be the single most condescending professor I have ever encountered. She thinks we&#39;re all stupid and she just laughs at everything. Her lecture is an enormous waste of time, unfortunately she takes I-clicker attendance. Her handwriting is both illegible and tiny. Effectively curves the class to a C which is just grand.Wow, I&#39;m so surprised by other reviews. Maybe I just learn well by example but I think he is great. Other than a few careless errors (ok, a lot) he explains his examples very well. If you go to lecture, the class is fairly easy.Petrina makes the class pretty straightforward and easy. Pretty good professor. Two problem sets a week and labs were VERY annoying and time consuming, but everything else is fine. Oh and he&#39;s not teaching 2020 anymore (feel sorry for everyone that has to take it with someone else now).One of my favorites at Cornell! She really cares about teaching, and is great at explaining things, both in lecture at office hours. She was very approachable and made lectures interesting. The class is undoubtedly hard, and you&#39;ll have to work for your grade, but there&#39;s a high level of support, and expectations are clear. Highly recommend!spent most lectures doing example problems on the board with no explanation as to what he was doing, and usually made so many mistakes he forgot what he was doing. Was often corrected by his co-lecturer.","difficulty":3.7435897436,"rating":2.8461538462},{"index":2393,"prof_name":"Wolfgang Sachse","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"ENGRD203","comment":"Talked like a train, barely had time to breathe.

Course is challenging in the sense that the homework does not prepare you for the exam. Projects are meaningless and time consuming. Highly recommend using Course Hero to redo the old prelims. Overall bad course.A very respectable and respectful professor who genuinely cares about his students. His care takes the form of wanting the best for the student, which doesn&#39;t translate into lax standards in any way. Excellent explanations. Office hours are incredibly valuable.While homework groups were annoying at times, they weren&#39;t terrible. All exams (3 prelims+final) were completely fair and if you took good notes in lecture and really understood homework and section problems, they were straight forward. Don&#39;t slack because it seems easier than PChem. Advice, do all problems yourself before exam so YOU actually knowHer methods for solving problems are pretty much irrelevant to the course but content was nothing too earth-shattering to begin with so it really didn&#39;t matter.

She sincerely cares about your success. However, I don&#39;t particularly like her teaching style of constant examples, and you learn a significant amount of useless material that will never be seen for the rest of the class.Although she makes a few errors in lecture, she is very sweet and sincerely wants you to do well (compare to other ENGR profs who want to assert their intelligence and make you feel stupid). The material can be a little tricky and tedious but with the amount of help available only sincere effort is required to do well.I did not put an ounce of work on this class. The material itself is very dry, but she tries her best to explain and solve a lot of examples. She&#39;s a really nice and helpful professor, but I just hated the course, so I skipped most lectures.

If you suck at probability like I did, be sure to study your ass before the first prelim or faHe just doesn&#39;t care whether you can follow the slides, follow the material. By far the worst professor and person I have come across at Cornell. He tries to make you get bad grades and suffer. And the curve is also ridiculous. Haven&#39;t seen anyone who did better than a C!I rated him before and I realized I was too lenient, so now this is correction. He isn&#39;t helpful at all, forces you to memorize everything, and doesn&#39;t post any practice problems. His class and homework TOTALLY do not prepare you for the exams, and the fact that my TA is crap doesn&#39;t help either.Resnick was easily the worst professor or teacher I&#39;ve ever had in 16 years of school. ENGRD 270 holds a similar distinction as the worst class I&#39;ve ever taken. For the final, he made up a 6 page formula sheet for review, but no notes or formulas were permitted for the exam. Avoid Resnick for 270!Yo!!! Yo this dude really wilded out on the class with his wild crazy lectures that made no sense half the time.  Mad heads were falling asleep in class and when you went to ask him for help or a question he was mad aloof and uninterested.  YO BUMP ENGRD 270!!! That joint was awwwwwwwful!!!TERRIBLE PROFESSOR! Exams are almost impossible with no practice exams given. Lectures are intolerably boring. Learned from the book but tests were nothing like the book so got screwed both ways. Curves to a C too.Materials before Prelim 1 were quite easy. But it becomes much more difficult after Prelim 2. Lectures are boring. Homeworks are killers to the end of the term. He is new in teaching introductory courses though (he called it introductory). Maybe he is too eager to bring materials from gradutate to a so-called introductory course.Horrible Professor. The little I learned from the class was from my own reading of the book. Definately the worst professor I&#39;ve had.  Lectures are really boring and exams are really difficult.  No practice exams are given.Great teacher, extremely knowledgeable about the subject.  Tried very hard to make lectures interesting, even though most students didn&#39;t care.  Very demanding, but fair, great guy.My worst professor for fall semester of my freshman year. The only reason I did fine was because I knew most stuff beforehand. Even then, I couldn&#39;t completely understand his notes because of poor explanation and cryptic notation. The prof is horrible at teaching!! But Jesus is a good, friendly TA!Sid is the worst prof I&#39;ve had at Cornell by FAR. In a lecture where 250+ people were enrolled, only 20 max showed up to class. I don&#39;t know why I kept going, I still barely managed to get a C.Very willing to help her students, gives time for them to ask questions and has sent emails explainging a personal question just within an afternoon.Worst TEACHER ever, this is my first write-up on &#34;Rate-Your-Professor&#34; and I am only doing it because  I wan&#39;t other CU students to avoid Resnick at all costs. His lectures are horrible and confusing, no wonder only 30 ppl max go to every lecture when there are hundeds in the course. RESNICK IS EVILVery nice teacher! Cares for students!!he is the most sinister person i have seen. Evil. Sadistic. told jokes which were NOT FUNNy. Only he laughed. Should learn some manners. Should learn to treat students with more respect. Then again, maybe he&#39;s just sad and lonely. After all, no one likes him. Avoid him if you have to take 270..Seems smart, but class isn&#39;t too fun. Class is too rushed near the end; too much material and just not enough practice problems. Also, he isn&#39;t too helpful. Ask him a question once and expect just one answer. Ask him again, and there&#39;re no guarentees he&#39;ll help.Can&#39;t believe Cornell pays him to teach a class. Average grade is a C, which means in a required introductory class, almost half the kids will fail the course. Boring lecture that no one goes to, and is an evil old man. Take his class at your own risk.Really nice teacher, who really cares about her students, and presents the material pretty competently overall.

Lectures are good and he emphasizes applications and understanding. When he&#39;s gone, Dr. Huang teaches, and Huang is not as good of a lecturer.

HWs are doable, exams are curved nicely.Hands down the most boring professor I&#39;ve ever had. She just reads off of the slides. She doesn&#39;t appear to know the material very well as she is unable to answer many questions. STAY AWAY if possible. Worst class I&#39;ve ever taken.Spent more time talking about personal life than lecturing on material.  Also, terrible at explaining material.  The class was easy enough though,Prof Lewis is a love or hate type of guy. I personally really enjoyed coming to class. He loves to tell funny stories and keep the class engaged. Many complain that he is a bad lecturer, but I think that the material is understandable and not that hard if one pays attention and reads the book outside of class. He is one of my favorite profs so far.As a person, Lewis is a great guy. Funny, interesting to talk to and willing to help. But he is a terrible lecturer and orator. Spent most of the time talking about random stuff and his life. However, tests were easy and I learned most of the class from the textbook and discussion.Chill professor. Actually makes an attempt to make stats interesting. The new zealand accent doesnt hurt either.Pretty boring class, but totally doable. Makes an effort to engage students, but the lecture slides are barely readable. Problem sets are not too hard, the problems he writes are harder than those from the book.He&#39;s pretty good. Material\/problem sets are extremely difficult but the test wasn&#39;t impossible. Could explain things more clearly. Humorous and could be interesting if the material he was teaching was more interesting!For a tough semester, Professor Pender was surprisingly understanding of individual circumstances. However, he is still strict on the leniency he doles out so I would not take advantage too much. Grading, tests, and assignments were very clearly laid out in the syllabus and I appreciate that there were no surprises in the semester.Tests are fair. He does not give the most interesting lectures (partly because of his accent), but if you pay enough attention you will learn a lot. Office hour can be super helpful since he only guides you through the problems and makes you do them by yourself. He is also very caring and offers extra office hours before exams.I only took this class because it worked for one of my requirements but I ended up loving this class so much. Professor Pender is really passionate about what he does and he genuinely cares about teaching this class. The class is not hard at all if you do everything he asks which again, is not much. Just pay attention to lectures and do the hw. &lt;3Lectures were extremely boring, but he revealed material on the prelims during class. He was extremely helpful in his office hours, and a very nice guy in general. Prelims and the final were very fair.Very unclear lectures, although his jokes are sometimes amusing. If you don&#39;t do well on the midterm, then 70% of your final grade depends on your final exam score, which is crazy thinking that your entire semester comes down to a 2.5 hour test. The curve must have been good though since somehow I did fairly well while not knowing anything.He&#39;s not the best lecturer, but he&#39;s a nice guy. I usually zone out during lecture because the material isn&#39;t very engaging, but it&#39;s easy enough that you can learn it by yourself. He&#39;s really nice with homework etc, I think we had 9 assignments for the whole semester, and they were all pretty easy. He makes sure you don&#39;t have hw over breaks!Resnick is by far the worst professor I have had at Cornell. He doesn&#39;t try to be engaging. His slides are borderline unintelligible.

He lets you know from the start that it is not a normal intro class in the fact that you must work hard and you learn, but if you stick through it you gain a whole new perspective on your chosen major. It does stink that he wrote the textbook because lectures can seem repetitive, but he is very personable and helpful in office hoursHe&#39;s an odd teacher - doesn&#39;t really teach to the style of the students, despite the fact that he says otherwise.

Was never clear on how much we already knew, was usually either teaching things too easy or else way above our head. Always seemed happy to be teaching and willing to help, but most people went to the TA for help before him. Very introductory course, not extremely enlightening. Final project was fun.I LOVED THIS CLASS!!! Made me really excited about Civil Engineering. The class was easy and interesting. Earls is really passionate about the material. Very helpful in office hours. No textbook, a few short homeworks, 1 paper, and a group project in the place of a final. The project was fun and a great way to apply the material.

She has a clear lecture plan for each class, and she posts her powerpoint slides. The homework is doable if you just read the slides, and the tests are easy if you do the homework. She is chill and gives extra credit.Class super easy except the final design project takes up way too much time fore a 1000 level engineering course. Doesn&#39;t really lecture and just goes over problems in class, which is really a better class structure.Really enjoyed this class. Lectures were usually enjoyable and the material was interesting but not too difficult. Labs can be very frustrating but the final project is a lot of fun. Good overview of mechanical engineering.She cares  about her students but often struggles to get a hold of their attention. Not a lot of work with the exception of the final project which takes way too much time for the course&#39;s level.Ritz is a pretty decent teacher. She&#39;s really helpful. She&#39;ll answer anything you have trouble with and she loves it when students come to her office hours. She&#39;s a really fair teacher. She tests her students on their knowledge, doesn&#39;t really seem to try to trick us. I really liked her! Take this class!Intro to MechE was a nightmare under Sachse. Neither Sachse nor the TAs effectively communicated what was expected at any step of the way. The lectures were disorganized and the material we were tested on was eons harder than what was in the online textbook. Studied much harder than for my other classes and it still ruined my GPA. Do not take!Amazing teacher with a genuine concern for her students. She Encourages participation in class, is open to many different views, and facilitates engaging discussions in her classes. Count getting her as a professor as a christmas present. Easily one of the worst instructors I&#39;ve had. Even though he posts notes online, it really doesn&#39;t help given how messy his handwriting is. Incredibly scatterbrained and disorganized. To top it all off, the lab TAs are incredibly incompetent. Be ready to be on your own. Wish I had come here before signing up for this class.Really bad at teaching the material because half the time he doesn&#39;t get it right and the student shave to correct him. He also goes on random tangents that don&#39;t help and ultimately confuse us more. He also has random guest lecturers cool but I&#39;d rather go over what we&#39;ve learned because he doesn&#39;t review at all and skims over everything.He&#39;s a really nice and funny guy. The grading is sometimes unclear, but he is always willing to help explain anything. Read the course packet notes he gives, you won&#39;t learn anything from the lectures. The lecture material was always way harder than anything tested on, the course packet is more accurate on what to expect. I believe he is retiring.Overall, Ritz is a clear, her class difficulty is fair, and she is a pretty good lecturer.  Instead of giving prelims, she gives ~10 (relatively easy) pop quizzes over the semester (I liked this policy).  She does give a final.  The final project was a lot of fun. My TA (Anoop) was the best TA I have ever had.  Labs were fun.What should have been an easy intro course was a nightmare. Sacshse had poor communication with TAs, unfair quizzes (meaning he would tell us that he&#39;d give us eq&#39;s to use and then forget about it), gave little guidance, and had poorly organized lectures. Time was better spent in lecture doing other hw, at least you would be efficient. Do NOT TAKEA bit strict for a freshman class, but overall very straightforward and helpful.

She is smart, stern, and well-respected. She shows no favoritism towards any specific students which is great, and she really values all ideas. She is impartial and a great teacher. I learned so much, and think everyone should take this course.Fantastic professor, her office hours are extremely helpful and is always willing to work with a student.

If you have TAs, they should be allowed to teach and see exams because they are there to learn to. A miserable and regrettable experience.Flavien has unrealistic expectations in terms of how much time students can allocate to French every day. We are full time students with loads of classes and work. He doesn&#39;t understand that. 1220 was quite possibly the most miserable class I&#39;ve ever taken. (ONE PRO- grading is weighted over lots of things (exams, hw, writing, etc)) Don&#39;t do it.Just horrible... Ti has constant mood swings an is very unclear about everything.  He never seemed to know what was going on, and exams were handed back weeks late.

If you&#39;re looking to improve your french and willing to put in the work, definitely take this class!I&#39;m not a french major, haven&#39;t taken french in 3 years and went into this class completely unprepared.

She encourages a lot of class discussion but she doesn&#39;t force it upon you. She was very understanding when I missed class but you gotta show up cause participation is a big deal. She&#39;s really good at being available for appointments too.If you want to keep your GPA high, I suggest you take a different liberal studies or at least one without Glidja. There was really no immersion, structure, or benefits from the class. Most of it was busy book work. A lot of busy book work.Flavien is a fabulous teacher who genuinely cares about his students. He is from Benin and has an interesting story  if you get to talk to him outside of class. Cool accent! I had him for French 209 back in Spring 2009. I was mistakenly placed in the class, so it was easy for me. The book was stupid so I just photocopied it from the libe.Professor Menard made a difficult subject very enjoyable and accessible.

You will learn a lot from this class!Really nice and smart professor, but this is an FWS class so she probably makes it a lot easier than her other classes. This class was very eye-opening and she clearly is passionate about teaching and her research. Pretty sure the average grade was an A.Really loved this class. Homework was just reading around 30-40 pages of a novel and then writing a few sentences on what parts of it we&#39;d include in our ideal world. No intermediary papers. Final paper is 15 pages describing your perfect society. Graded very generously, mostly on effort. Highly recommend it.  Median was an A- for the course.Great professorBensel is great.  It took me almost the entire FWS session to figure our where his political affiliation was because he&#39;s so good at arguing all sides... something I haven&#39;t seen in enough professors.  Take one of his classes, he&#39;s amazing.I took my FWS with Bensel, and it was a lot of fun. The course discussed many interesting topics about the formation of a society, and he facilitated great conversations.

Lectures are dry and you don&#39;t have to pay attention; but do know the terms she emphasizes (you&#39;ll know).  The homework and essays aren&#39;t hard, they just take time.  Overall, a pretty enjoyable class, especially everything going on in the world.Loved prof Kriner! He puts so much effort into his lectures, and the workload is totally manageable, all while learning a tremendous amount.Kriner seems like a nice guy, but in lectures all he does in ramble on. You can literally see him reading off of his screen during live lectures AND pre-recorded lectures, so it&#39;s hard to engage with the material he&#39;s reciting. He also makes you read overly-long material before class. (BEWARE if you have no background in US gov \/ history)Lectures are fascinating and always involve real-world applications\/examples. Trump&#39;s impeachment inquiry began a month after class started, and Kriner adjusted on the fly and dedicated a bunch of class time to the impeachment proceedings. Somewhat easy A if you engage with the material.Prof. Kriner gives lively lectures with opportunities for student input; theres a clear rationale throughout. Course went through insightful analysis on history of and contemporary debates on American government.Terrible beyond words. Rambling, unclear lectures combined with vague essay prompts not even remotely related to the material in the readings and lectures. It was so bad that the TA even apologized to our section for her lack of effort. Condescending and rude during office hours-- basically told me to go away when I asked for clarification on essayReadings are dense sometimes, but are always analyzed in the discussion section so you can get the main ideas. In his lectures, it was clear that he puts a lot of time and effort into considering what to talk about - he does a lot of case studies\/data analysis, and he is so accessible in office hours and invites student participation always!Although attendance grade does not take up a significant portion, you would need to attend her classes to see what are highlighted.  Skipping the discussion sessions is also fatal. It is almost 20% of your grade. The course has some small homework assignments but they are based on participation not quality.She was a good lecturer although sometimes it did get rather dull. She&#39;s very data oriented so that can get tedious to listen to at times. Overall she is very passionate about the subject and open to discussion and questions. There is a heavier load of outside reading to do between classesThe lectures tend to be a bit vague, and it is incredibly obvious what her political views tend to be.  Other than that, she is a sweet person who has passion for what she teaches.Lectures are amazing! Clear, concise, and helpful. She doesn&#39;t go on tangents and focuses on the material. Presents it in a very interesting, thought-provocative way. Truly cares about her class and her students (remembers people&#39;s names and what they&#39;ve said). The textbook &amp; almost all the summaries of all readings can be found online ;)))I wouldn&#39;t say she&#39;s terrible. She is really sweet and really passionate about her work. However, the papers were quite vague at times and there was a lot of reading  (tbh you can sort of bs it unless you want discussion to be awkward). Also, it&#39;s hard to determine what grade you have till the end (the median grade is an A- though!)Although you can tell hes reading from a script, I appreciated his effort to organize lectures in a way that helped students study for exams. I loved staying after lecture to listen to him answer students questions; I could tell that Kriner loved what he was teaching and was happy to see students engage.His lectures were incredibly boring. I swear he was reading off a script during class. His lecture slides were disorganized and all over the place. However, we had really good discussions during class. We also only had four assignments due throughout the semester, and they were super light.I really enjoyed this class. A lot of the material overlapped with AP Gov, which was nice. The lectures were interesting, very organized and easy to understand. The essays are a little harder and are graded based on how closely you answer the prompt. You can also get a lot of participation credit if you&#39;re up to date on current events.Professor Mettler is such a kind person who absolutely loves what she does.  She is always more than happy to talk to people outside of class and makes an effort to keep class interesting, even in a large intro class.  I sincerely am glad that I was able to take the class, which is relatively easy, and get to know her.She&#39;s a decent lecturer who knows what she&#39;s talking about. Can be a little dry and repetitive at times, but overall interesting subject. Textbook isn&#39;t necessary per se but probably I&#39;d try to read it as much as reasonably possible. TAs can be hit or miss.Great lectures that were engaging and gave time for feedback on questions from students to make lectures more interactive. Easily accessible and great feedback during office hours.Mettler isn&#39;t exactly the most interesting professor but she is a solid choice... Clear expectations and well-developed lectures and assignments.  If you have a basic understanding of American politics, it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to pull of an A.Mettler is very engaging in lectures and does so by walking around the room and encouraging students to share their answers with the lecture class. Easy to stay engaged and focused.Professor Mettler is an excellent professor who is very clear with her expectations and one of the most engaging lecturers that I have had at Cornell. She takes her job very seriously and is very dedicated. I liked that she broke up the monotony of lecture with questions to the class and I thought that the course readings were really interesting.Terrible. Avoid at all costs. Abysmal lecturer, condescending, unclear expectations.As a person, she is  good-natured, and genuinely cares about getting to know her students on a personal level as much as she can. She also really allowed for a discussion of current events to dominate, and made herself available to students seeking help or advice (not just with the course. Lectures can be a bit dry\/dull at times though.A great professor that conveys ideas clearly and powerfully. Great introductory course to Government. The materials and concepts will challenge your thoughts and increase your interests in politics. lecture is organised with clear flow.Professor Mettler does a really good job for a broad intro course. She is organized, clear, and very helpful if you go to office hours. Readings are helpful but not totally necessary if you pay attention in class.

Hard to stay awake despite the interesting topic. Kind and funny but not very engaging.The man has good intentions. He clearly cares about comparative politics (don&#39;t get him started on African politics), however, his lectures are boring as f.... they are not as intriguing as one might hope. If you are considering being a Government major, please don&#39;t take his class. if you have insomnia, please do, for he will put you to sleep. zzzLectures can be kind of boring, but the content is always very relevant. His examples are always super interesting due to his knowledge of African political systems. Super nice and adorable, willing to engage students, and admit his shortcomings. I learned so much in his class, and would recommend, but feel free to skip a lecture every so often.While I agree that Roberts did a good job of explaining concepts, I think his lectures were incredibly boring. He basically repeated what was on the slides (which, as I said, were very good), and I found it hard to stay focused. There was also way too much reading for a 3-credit course. That being said, the TAs were pretty good, and I learned alot.Professor van de Walle is overall a solid professor. Some students find his lectures boring but he tends to simply embody the classic Ivy lecturer. If you pay attention, his lectures are fairly engaging. Definitely raise your hand and ask questions, he remembers. Pay close attention to readings, that&#39;s where test concepts come from.great professor who lectures kind of slowly but very clearly. prelims and final are clear and straightforward. he also provides lots of helpful study resources such as key terms lists and lecture notes. skipping lectures won&#39;t much of a problem and supplementary readings that aren&#39;t textbook are completely unnecessaryI think this class really depends on your TA. Mine was amazing, so I liked it. The lectures are really boring, but the prof. is adorable! He&#39;s super dopey and loves answering questions. The readings are completely unnecessary. He goes over the important parts during lecture and usually just disagrees with the rest. I didn&#39;t do a single one.Professor van de Walle is a really amazing professor. Yes his lectures a little boring but I learned SO MUCH from this class. Would definitely take again.Dear Lord, the lectures can be a struggle to get through. The material is interesting enough and not particularly complicated, but he tends to ramble quite a bit. He has his moments though; very passionate, can be kind of sweet\/dopey, and encourages questions and discussion. Pretty easy to BS, I skipped a lot of lectures, and only read sometimes.Very nice and sweet guy. Approachable after class.  Very interesting lectures that dove into nonconventional discussions and raised some very important questions.  Good for an intro to comparative politics and very knowledgable.I love the professor. he&#39;s so sweet and passionate about the topic. the ta I had was a really hard grader, so this class wasn&#39;t worth taking.He is very helpful and approachable. He knows a lot about Latin America, and he succeeded at making his lectures interesting and relatively easy to get through - not boring.Great professor who really cares about his students. Lectures are fun and interesting. He shows up everyday with a smile on his face, you can tell he enjoys teaching. I learned a lot and it&#39;s definitely a class worth taking for anybody.Nice prof.All in all the professor is a nice guy and would discuss subject matter in depth with any student. However, lectures are extremely dry, and the excessive reading is completely unnecessary. I did none of the reading and still did fine. He uploads lecture powerpoints and study guides so there is no need to attend lectures.His lectures were pretty well organized and mostly interesting depending on the topic at hand. He&#39;s pretty serious but can be pretty funny\/sarcastic. He encourages and takes questions asked during lecture seriously.lectures were extremely unhelpful and confusing. reading was ridiculous and unhelpfulAlthough he is a nice guy, Van de Walle&#39;s lectures are terribly boring. He manages to take very interesting subject matter and put it in the least interesting terms possible. Additionally, grading really depends on your TA, and my section received much lower grades than other sections, indicating a lack of communication between TA and professor.Professor van de Walle is such a kind professor and he is so clearly intelligent it was a pleasure to learn from him. This course was extremely interesting though at times I was very discouraged by the discussion sections because they got too abstract and didn&#39;t really match the level of the lectures.Very uninspiring lecturer with unengaging TAs.

Lectures can be very interesting but they can also often be difficult to stay attentive to at 8:40am. Essays require a lot of effort but the prompts are interesting. Readings are dense and usually more than 100 pages\/week. I would recommend taking fall intro gov classes (Amer, IR)Professor Markell does not know his audience. He assigns hundreds of pages of readings weekly and then never mentions any of them in class. His lectures are full of insane irrelevant tangents that not even the TAs can explain. He enforces lecture attendance with two pop quizzes because no one would attend otherwise. Avoid at all costs.He was just ok. Very passionate about the subject, but his lectures were wandering and sometimes lacked focus. It was his first time teaching the large lecture course, so perhaps he&#39;s better in smaller settings...By far the worst professor I&#39;ve ever encountered. Assigns complex 100 page readings and then talks endlessly in class about completely irrelevant topics without a single slide or point on the board. Zero guidance or structure for papers. Stopped attending after spring break to maintain my sanity. Avoid at all costs. Take comparative instead.Prof Markell is a great political theorist. His lectures are pretty bland (sound like he&#39;s reading an essay), but he is nonetheless interesting and well-spoken. Pay attention to lecture because he throws bones for the pop quizzes. Readings are  100 pages per week. Do the readings and show up to discussion and you&#39;ll get at least an A-.Take his class!!!! One of the best lecturers you will encounter at Cornell! Jason Frank is absolutely brilliant and the class wasn&#39;t that difficult. The median was an A-, so as long as you read the material and listen to the lectures you are fine.He is a great professor, and actually peaked my interest in Theory. Don&#39;t miss lecture though, because he does have a lot to say.BEST and HOTTEST professor ever. Smart. Eloquent. Passionate. Helpful. Great lecturer. Nough said.He&#39;s one of those professors that are simply too smart to teach. The man seems to possess unlimited knowledge, but is unable to impart any of it onto his students. His lectures are marked by three bullet points on a chalkboard, long irrelevant tangents, and a hall full of sleeping students. Do not take this class.bestHe is so far my favorite professor at Cornell. The reading material is quite difficult, but his lectures magically conveys the ideas in those texts in a clear and in-depth way. He is extremely passionate about the topic and he interacts with students in his lectures actively. All these aspects adds to the attractiveness of his personality.average professor who seems good because of passion and delivery. grading is based 3 papers and discussion. lectures generally have little to do with the actual paper prompts. if ur a good writer and can understand the readings well and incorporate that into ur essays u can get an AAmazing Lectures! He is exceedingly intelligent and insightful. I would definitely recommend taking him. His lectures are able to put the readings into great perspective, and he made me excited about political theory.Very interesting material and fascinating lectures you won&#39;t want to miss.

Professor Levine gives amazing lectures that are engaging and well-organized.

I thought the exams were fair, but they will be difficult if you don\u2019t take good notes in lecture.Adam is simply a wonderful professor. His passion and knowledge for political science is unmatched and he is very witty as well. There&#39;s no need to do the readings; his lectures explain them perfectly. The discussion sections were helpful too.If you at all are interested in government at Cornell, you must have him as a teacher at least once.Professor Levine is a great professor and the most interesting professor that I&#39;ve had at Cornell so far. He&#39;s extremely fair and his lectures are engaging and he has a great sense of humor as well.Very engaging and passionate professor. I learned a ton!Really cool material. Definitely changed the way I think about campaigns. The professor is very approachable and often invites questions during lectures. He&#39;s also a terrific lecturer. He does not post lecture slides so make sure you attend.One of my favorite gov classes! Professor Levine is fantastic and extremely engaging. His lectures make the 8:40 worth it. If you can&#39;t get up for class though, you may want to skip this one. He does not post the slides and does take attendance.Adam Levine is one of the best professors I have had at Cornell. You have to go to class everyday, but you don&#39;t have to do the readings. The tests are pretty easy if you review your notesAbsolutely an awesome lecturer.

The class isn&#39;t that hard (the midterm was multiple choice and short answers) and he is very approachable outside of class if you have any questions.Prof Levine is the best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell. His lectures are lively and interesting even at 8:40am. Class is structure pretty different than most Cornell gov classes- multiple choice exams and one large paper\/project. Really easy to get an A. Just take advantage of his office hours and the TAsDefinitely a great class to take! His lectures are clear and he always summarizes the readings well. He&#39;s passionate about the subject and the material is genuinely interesting and will change the way you think about elections. The grading is super easy (the median grade was an A) as well.Really cheerful and exciting guy. Loves the material and loves answering questions. His grading is very clear and the TA&#39;s seemed to give everyone pretty good grades. You really learn the material wellFantastic and pretty easy class. The readings Levine picks are stellar.

He does not even know the material himself. He is pretentious, dry, and he contradicts his own material. This course is mandatory but I&#39;d rather not graduate than take this class. He should be fired immediately.The class is not enjoyable at all. He does not care about his students. All he does is give incredibly hard quizzes that ask you very specific questions. His exams are also unnecessarily hard. He is also very uptight during exams and won&#39;t let you ask any questions at all even if they are just clarifying questions. I miss the old professor.He gives out almost weekly reading quizzes online to do. He told us they would be simple if you done the reading but they are very specific with a bunch of numbers and thus it&#39;s quite complicated even as someone who did all the reading. His exams are crazy as well. They are so heavy in material and nothing like past professors of Food Ops. BAD PROFVery approachable and funny. Easy to understand material. If you don&#39;t understand how to do problems, go to his office hours. Minimal effort  BHe is an excellent teacher, soo funny!  If you pay attention and go to his reviews you&#39;ll be fine!A great professor! He worked in the industry long before teaching, so he&#39;s extremely passionate and knowledgeable. I found his lectures to be very interesting, while others do not; just depends on if you&#39;re interested in the material. Go to his review sessions for prelims, they&#39;re extremely useful because he tells you what he&#39;s going to ask!Susskind&#39;s lectures are tedious.  He also tends to make up terms that don&#39;t exist outside of his class and makes you memorize them.  Go to the exam review sessions!The information is not very usefulVery nice and interesting guy! I laugh every time he makes a joke!I didn&#39;t learn anything from this class. Based on memorization, nothing good comes out of it. Prof. Susskind seems jolly and nice on the outside, but he really isn&#39;t helpful and doesn&#39;t seem to care about students. His grading system is confusing and insensible. I didn&#39;t get a bad grade in the class, but I learned nothing and did not enjoy it.She SUCKS... Literally french and extremely sassy. She considers you asking her a question in private &#34;a breach of academic integrity&#34;. She gives quizzes after every reading yet due to her lack of knowledge of the English language, everyone manages to somehow fail because she can not phrase them coherently. DONT TAKE and FEEL FREE TO THANK ME LATERAdalja is a great prof. He is accessible outside of class and so on top of his game.Prof. Adalja is genuinely one of the nicest people I&#39;ve met at Cornell-- and is insanely intelligent with really cool experience to share. I don&#39;t know a single person last year who didn&#39;t enjoy his class and get something out of it. If Food Ops was put in the hands of the wrong person it could easily be boring, but Adalja makes sure that it isn&#39;t.The workload and difficulty of the class are reasonable and he is very approachable outside of class. I&#39;m not interested in F&amp;B, but this was a good intro class to complement my hotel education.

If you get an F, take him again.  He&#39;s worth as many Fs as it takes.Prof. Snow is an unbelievably inspiring person: he can help you identify and further strengthen your writing and speaking talents.

I thought she was pretty good for Man comm, she is a good mix between Snow and Arlisse\/Dahl. You actually will learn something and she won&#39;t harass you like Snow.The professor knows the subject like nobodys business but he is subjective in grading. If you are a girl with pretty smile, and you know english grammar well you are lucky. If you are a guy the battle is lost, dont even try...Class with snowman is no walk in the park. So if you&#39;re looking for an easy A don&#39;t get him! but if you&#39;re willing to work hard and put effort into the class, you will be fine and get so much value from it.

He gives a TON of busywork and he never returned most of our writing assignments, so we had no way to know what to change\/improve. Takes off lots of points if he sees you on your phone or if you miss class. AVOID!!He does not believe in awarding A&#39;s. You can attend his and every TA&#39;s office hours, but if your writing is not the best he has ever seen, you will not get an A in the course. Hope that you get a different professor because he will not boost your GPA in any way. He also does not round your grade and does not give out extra credit. Good luck!Walden is an awful teacher. His lectures are boring and dull, and he lacks basic communications skills. During the coronavirus pandemic, he made little effort to ensure our wellbeing or communicate updates to the course. He also never gives feedback yet grades harshly. He makes us call him professor, which is weird, seeing he&#39;s only a lecturer...He&#39;s the best professor I&#39;ve ever had. Sure-- he&#39;s tough, but he teaches you everything he knows. Many &#34;Snow Survivors&#34; (including myself) have received job\/internship offers becuase of the way he taught us to write. I tell everyone I know, from A&amp;S undergrads to Johnson School of Business students, to take his class.Terrible teacher. He makes no sense. Shouldn&#39;t be teaching.Professor Quagliata is one of best professors I have ever had. He is kind and understanding, but also extremely helpful. I learned a lot and gained so much from his class. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s an easy A, but if you work hard, you will get an A. And you will learn along the way.He has no consistent way in grading and just grades on his whim. He definitely plays favorites and is a terrible teacher. As a ManComm teacher who teaches communication skills, you would think he would be better at communicating his own ideas. It&#39;s literally &#34;my way or the highway&#34; in his class.He is a nice and interesting professor. He is also a hard grader but the class is easy if you do your work.If you are Asian, you basically start off with a C in the class. After receiving a D for an assignment, I visited his office hour, but was cut off in the middle as he only allocated 10 minutes of his time.

Hes a very kind and fun-loving person but he is not an effective professor. Most of the material covered in exams are never gone over in class or homework. The exams always have low averages but he curves them so everyone can do decently. The lectures are hard to follow and youll have to teach yourself the material.Really nice guy and pretty good lecturer. Prelims are hard even if you&#39;re prepared - finishing in time is the biggest issue so get fast at doing problems.

Group projects were also pretty easy.At most universities, there are a few great professors, a lot of average ones, and some mediocre ones. In Paz&#39;s case, I think it is safe to say that taking accounting with him has been one of the most dreadful experiences I have ever endured during my time at Cornell. For such a dry subject, Paz just doesn&#39;t possess the ability to teach it.Paz may not be the most interesting lecturer, but he is very understanding and fair. The first few homeworks are long and tedious, but afterwards, they&#39;re pretty manageable. The prelims, despite what the past few commenters said, were pretty much straight from the homework.Professor Strebel gives students many chances and is open to helping. The exams can be difficult if you are not familiar with how the questions will be asked but that is generally how most accounting classes are. You won&#39;t find a better and more accommodating professor to take an intro accounting class with. He truly acts in your best interest!Prof. Strebel is good at teaching accounting. He combines exercise and homework together for us to practice. The prelims are sometimes difficult, but you can take every exam twice. Homework takes time at first, but you will get used to it.Accounting is definitely not &#34;fun&#34; per se, but Strebel does it good job in making his students understand a lot of the material through homework, in-class exercises, and review sessions. It&#39;s a bit of work, but I felt like I learned SO MUCH from this class!!! Also, he gives Extra Credit problems in his two prelims, where you can earn up to 10 pts!Cho is not great at explaining by himself, but he does do a great job of answering questions. He also offers explanations examples on the Ed Stem discussion boards. But, he speaks monotously and takes pauses between every sentence so it&#39;s very tiresome. He draws diagrams that are messy &amp; confusing instead of having clear lecture slides. Kind thoughProf. Cho is good. Like any other class, your dedication is a direct factor of your success. The semester started only a couple weeks ago, but I can tell he really knows his stuff, and his course policies are reasonable. You really have to focus in class to follow along, but as long as you do the pre-class activities, you&#39;ll be fine.Very easy accounting class, but thorough enough that I felt satisfied. He tells funny stories about people getting indited for fraud, and is all-around an excellent professor. His tests were pretty easy, and he offered 10% extra credit on the two prelims (but not the final).Financial Accounting isn&#39;t the most glamorous subject, but Strebel has a lot real-world experience that makes the class interesting. He&#39;s very straightforward- he teaches you the concepts, the weekly homework and in-class exercises give you material to practice, and the exams are like the homework.Professor Strebel is a great intro accounting professor. He is very clear with his work and his prelims and exams are fair. The homework can sometimes take a few hours if you struggle with the material but generally is only assigned once a week. Overall great professorHonestly he&#39;s one of the most nicest and best professors Ive ever had. I honestly wish I could give him an even higher rating. He&#39;s very polite and if you need help, he always has your back. I would strongly recommend.Financial accounting is hard no matter what professor you take it with. Paz is an incredibly nice man, and genuinely wants his students to understand the material. Homework can 15 minutes or 3 hours. Doing well on HW and in this class is completely dependent on how hard you work to learn. Read the book, ask questions, and you&#39;ll do great.very nice guyHe&#39;s an overall good guy. I&#39;m not the biggest fan of econ\/math but this class isn&#39;t bad at all. Dude just reads of the slides but funny and gave 3% extra credit to all students at end of the year. Also Head TA is very dedicated. Take accounting with him and not AEM. Study three days before each test and you&#39;ll get an AThe fact that I pay tens of thousands of dollars to attend such a prestigious university just to end up taking classes taught by the likes of Prof Paz makes me seriously question why I go to Cornell in the first place. He just can&#39;t teach, end of story.Tests were very difficult and even though i worked very hard on homeworks and attended every lecture, still did very poorly in the class.Professor Paz is a great professor. He teaches well, cares about his students and is the kind of person you simply want to be around. The class can be challenging but he is more than happy to provide help. By far one of the kindest and funniest professors at Cornell.Clear lecturer, follows textbook closely. Material is straightforward, can be dry. Homework can be tedious\/ unnecessarily long and repetitive. Exams are fair, watch out for multiple choice. In class quizzes to give attendance; a few times he abruptly changes day of the week and time in lecture of quiz to throw people who skip offHe is a pretty fair professor.

Book is not as important as her lecture slides. All the concepts on the test are on the slides. Take notes of her explanations in class. Copy everything she writes in class. Redo the problems. Understand the concepts behind each step. Problems on prelims and final  problems from lecture. I learned a lot.Linda Canina was one of my most memorable professors at Cornell. Her unique sense of humor and lecture style kept me engaged throughout the hour-plus lecture, and I felt I learned a lot from her class. She LOVES to call on students- it kept everyone on their toes and definitely made class more interesting. Would highly recommend this course.Pr. Canina&#39;s lectures are interesting, and should be treated as a supplement to the book. Tests are usually drawn from the book, but by going to the lecture it is possible to determine on what they are going to focus. She obviously cares about the class and students, sometimes to the point of making  disinterested students care about the class.

Tests often include a few ambiguous questions, which can get annoying.  For a class that incorporates videos of cute babies, it&#39;s surprisingly boring.  She&#39;s not a bad instructor, but I wouldn&#39;t take this class for the purpose of having a fun elective class.Awful! Took her class as an intro level Human Development to fill a social science requirement and saw that all we do in class is watch youtube videos. Tests were written by TAs. Not a good prof at all.Class is beyond boring and she only reads from a sheet. You can get a good grade from paying attention (very tough) in lecture AND doing study guides. don&#39;t read the textbook until you do the study guides, it&#39;ll be pointlessInteresting class, easy enoughDr. Kushnir is fantastic! Very smart, knowledgeable, fun, and passionate about her field. She likes to challenge, and be challenged by students, but does so in a way that is inspirational and constructive. She really believes in her students and wants them to succeed.Boring. Annoying. Made me rethink my major.Great and caring professor with lots of extra credit opportunities. If you are a good test-taker, you will succeed in this class, as it is all memorization.She is very nice and funny. Clear lectures and lots of extra credits. Tests are okay - not too hard but include couple short answer questions. Tests materials are mostly from lecture. Would definitely take her class again if possibleProfessor Kushnir&#39;s lectures are clear and she does a good job keeping the material interesting by including debates and podcasts. There is plenty of room for extra credit, which is very helpful, because although the tests aren&#39;t hard, you really need to know the material well to do well.The class itself is doable. Just read the textbook alongside attending class and the extra credit can boost your grade. The professor seems really nice in class, but outside of class, she can be very dismissive. I decided it wasn&#39;t worth going to office hours after she kept asking why I didn&#39;t check w\/a friend. Wouldn&#39;t recommend unless necessary.She&#39;s really nice and encourages questions. There are four tests, and the lowest grade gets dropped. Tests are all multiple-choice, and take more from the lectures than the textbook. A good amount of reading is assigned, but it&#39;s really fine to just look at the vocabulary and charts. Each extra credit usually asks for a paragraph or two.This class is really fun with tons of videos of babies. The grading policy is really nice- lowest of 4 test grades is dropped. Easy and interesting class.she&#39;s awful! she reads straight from a script during lecture and seems to keep repeating the same thing over and over again. lecture material is totally unorganized. i only go to class for the clicker points. i relied on takenote for the class and the study guides that she posts on blackboardBoring and slow lectures but interesting material.Professor Kushnir is a great person! She is very friendly and approachable. BUT the way she taught this class made it so difficult for me to actually enjoy the subject. If you are an HD major (Human Development), you&#39;re required to take a discussion class which focuses mostly on research methods.Class is extremely easy. She will give you a study guide before the exams. Answer the questions on the study guide, pay attention in lecture and you will have an easy APrelims are factual and very doable, lecture slides provide most of the information you need, and the baby videos are absolutely adorable!! Prof. Kushnir cracks a joke from time to time, so make sure to laugh.Very understanding of the stress that comes with a global pandemic, and TA&#39;s are very lenient. I took this as a science requirement and loved it (I usually hate science). There are weekly quizzes but they are easy if you watch all lectures and skim the textbook. There is a large final project but it is broken up so it&#39;s not overwhelming.Pretty good professor. She says things like &#34;come visit me in office hours, I&#39;d love to meet all of you&#34;, but then she doesn&#39;t ever seem particularly friendly or interested. Overall though it&#39;s a fun class, the textbook is good, and prof Kushnir is solid.Really nice person, loved this classBy far my favorite class so far at Cornell, and I&#39;m not even an HD major. The material was super easy to understand to begin with, but Kushnir made me enjoy it that much more. Some tricky questions on tests, but the extra credit can pull you up a whole letter grade if you do it. Would definitely recommend as a fun elective!Sweet professor. Always looking for the class to answer questions &amp; talk, but no one does. Class is based on 3 prelims, lowest grade dropped. and 6 points of extra credit are provided that go right on your raw average. Several helpful TAs. Really interesting &amp; easy class if you like psych or babies! Highly recommend. She loves talking to studentsProfessor Kushnir is the best science professor I&#39;ve ever had.  She is wicked smart, funny, and a bit of a goof.  Behind it all is one of the most amazing minds I&#39;ve ever seen at Cornell.

Plus her personality is so adorable.The class can be confusing at times, but Prof. Casasola is SO nice. I sent her an email the night before our project was due about having no idea what I was doing, and she gave me her personal phone number and explained everything to me. She&#39;s the perfect person to be teaching research methods. Definitely recommend the class for HD majors!Professor Casasola is an incredibly caring professor who wants students to achieve. She knows Research Methods is a required class for HD majors and tries to make it as enjoyable as possible, but it is still very research based and knitpicky (especially APA format). You write 2 research papers over the semester, and they&#39;re not graded easily.The class isn&#39;t very difficult. You don&#39;t need to go to lecture. They are very nitpicky with grading, so go to office hours as much as you can to figure out what they want. The class is fine--kind of boring, but fine (and required for some).I was a little intimidated when I first headed into this class, but she is extremely clear about what she expects from students, and always willing to help out too. Follow her instructions, and you should do solid. Your final grade will be indicative of your time spent on assignments. The bulk of your grade, 55%, comes from two research projects.I took this class as a freshman, and absolutely loved it. Prof. Casasola was incredibly helpful, detailed, and really pushed her students to succeed. The bulk of your grade comes from two research projects - you&#39;ll learn a lot about academic writing, APA formatting, and the scientific method. Highly recommend!Research Methods is a class I would highly recommend to anyone who asked. Last year I was forced to write research papers without being shown how. Professor Casasola takes the time to make sure you learn what to do and what not to do when conducting an experiment and writing a paper. Her class requires some work, but she is very fair. Love her!She is SO nice. I kind of wish her grading was a little more lenient for A+s (I had a 98 and was still given an A) but she is still great. Very helpful, clear about what she wants.

Hazan is a great professor and researcher with information-packed and engaging lectures. Multiple choice questions on prelims can be tough, but tests overall are very fair. Don&#39;t do the readings until the outline comes out because only certain sections are required. Also, the final was about 80% repeats!One of Cornell&#39;s most beloved classes, taught by one of its most beloved professors.

She knows how to give a lecture, they are very entertaining with so much useful information. Her tests are hard, make sure you do all of the readings. Given that, she is very enjoyable and you can go to her office hours and ask any question about relationships. highly recommendedHands down the greatest professor, and greatest class, I&#39;ve taken at Cornell. If you can take this course, 100% do.You will walk out of this class with knowledge that you will use for the rest of your life. If you&#39;re in a relationship or ever plan on being in one, this class is incredibly insightful. Lectures feel like TED talks, they&#39;re fun and laid back. No homework, just study for the exams and do the readings (short, interesting) the night before.TAKE HUMAN BONDING! Such a great class, the material is super interesting (love, relationships, etc.) Don&#39;t skip the lecturesthat&#39;s the best part of the class! Get a study group before the prelims, they&#39;re straightforward, but cover a lot of material. Really cool class and great professor.A bit disorganized and scattered in some lectures. Good overall.The best professor I&#39;ve ever had at Cornell. Her class is not easy, but if you work hard it&#39;s incredibly rewarding and you learn a lot. Tests can be difficult, but her amazing teaching style definitely makes the class worth it!Great professor in class, but can be very unfair if she doesn&#39;t like you and she is often moody.Human Bonding is a wonderful class and Professor Hazan is an extremely competent professor. I was always really excited to go in and learn. I should note that there are certain concepts that she really beats into the ground, but she is sweet enough that it makes up for it. Go up and talk to her after class!While the material for this class was interesting, the exams were completely unfair. The tests are ridiculously specific and the TA&#39;s do not grade the exams fairly (even though it takes them about 3 weeks to grade them anyway). Must memorize a lot of information and even if you read the entire book, there is no guarantee that you&#39;ll do well.Amazing professor! One of my favorite classes at Cornell!!

His lectures are very engaging, and coming to class prepared is a must because he does ask a lot of questions to keep you interested and make sure you are understanding the material.I&#39;ve taken three classes with Professor Minawi because I love him so much! He is extremely engaging and makes you excited about the material. He is also very approachable, helpful, and overall a reasonable professor. Definitely recommend any of his classes!Take this guy&#39;s class. Professor Minawi is fantastic at actually teaching, so you&#39;ll learn a lot. He has interesting perspectives and I love when he goes on these passionate 10-minute tangents about history. His classes aren&#39;t hard if you put in effort. He is a very, very reasonable, down-to-earth person IF you put in some semblance of effort.","difficulty":3.25,"rating":5.0},{"index":3028,"prof_name":"Jon Parmenter","prof_dept":"History","class_name":"HIST158","comment":"Good teacher - pretty good lecturer and section leader.

Could stand to be a little bit more structured and clear in his lectures. Exams are fairly easy, and essentially factual. Just come to all the lectures, take good notes, and study the term sheets he gives out. Course readings are a bonus, but not crucial.At first, I thought his lectures were boring, but then I realized how interested he is in the material and that got me more intersted in it too. His tests are pretty easy--just memorize terms.  Sections were great too.  A very nice, understanding person as well.Avoid at all costs. A decent lecturer who has NO IDEA how to teach a history course. Instead of testing your grasp of the basic storyline or historical interpretation you are expected to memorize random disconnected facts and spit them out on exams. His grading standards are ridiculous. He is a nice guy, but avoid his classes.He&#39;s passionate about the material (Islamic Civilization), and this is always an asset. His lectures were coherent and the readings were enjoyable. The exams are easy -- pure memorization. However, be warned that he&#39;s very intimdating in his office.

The class gives engaging material, and exams are not all that hard. One of the best history classes here (and I&#39;ve taken a lot).I heart Professor Strauss!  Most profs who are as prominent in their fields as he is usually come across as pompous and arrogant, but Strauss is so down-to-earth and adorable.  Wonderful lecturer and very approachable in office hours.  You must take a class with him before graduating--he will truly go down as one of Cornell&#39;s best!Barry is amazing.  He is the most professor-y professor I have ever met.  I love the class, and he just makes me smile.  He is funny, sweet, and enjoys long walks on Mediterranean beaches.  In summary: everyone at Cornell should take a Barry Strauss class.Dude, ask him to be your advisor anyway. (I did!  Yay!) Just because he&#39;s going on leave doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t be able to reach him when you need advice--it just means he&#39;s not teaching classes or holding office hours per-se.

Also, he isn&#39;t totally fluent in English, which makes the classes confusing.He&#39;s got some really fascinating theories, but he just CAN&#39;T complete his sentences.  It&#39;s awful--and then he accuses the students of taking bad notes when they can&#39;t figure out what he&#39;s talking about later.  The material really isn&#39;t that hard--he makes it so.  Don&#39;t take this class with him.This utterly unreasonable professor initially expected us to complete 12 short answer questions plus map area identification in the finals in 1 hour (50 minutes, actually)! If no one had brought it up during the Q and A session, God knows what would have happened!I&#39;m appalled at the commentary thus far.

The man has evaluated 1 portion of 1 exam (the TA&#39;s have done the rest) and we know the TA&#39;s are grading a lot of the final (which is tomorrow so all previous posts are ridiculous in their accusations of unfair grading). The guy gave extra credit too. Guys, Less posting, more workingI&#39;ve read the comments on this board and agree that while Prof. Rebillard may be a nice person, he can&#39;t inspire a class! I agree with the unfair grading part--just because he didn&#39;t grade that many papers doesn&#39;t mean that he&#39;s fair. Also worth remembering is that students are PAYING HIM to teach.Although he is kind of boring and the accent gets a bit old after awhile, the second half of the semester was better than the first.

A lot of work, but when it&#39;s over and you don&#39;t have to take a final it feels worth it.  You learn a lot, but work hard to learn it.  Prof Gold is intimidating at first, but if you ask him for help he&#39;s very receptive and willing.Surviving this class is quite an accomplishment.  A typical week consisted on 3-4 homework assignments and 2-3 quizzes.  Plus, he is also the type of professor who takes advantage of the fact that Cornell schedules breaks to start at 1 in the afternoon.  Also, don&#39;t plan on sleeping come paper time.Prof. Gold is one of the most handsomely dressed men at Cornell.  A throwback to a gone era when professors never wore jeans and and always wore a tie.  He classes it up with an array of argiles, sweater vests, and bow ties.  He also has the academic prowess of no one i&#39;ve had at CornellA dapper gentleman indeed, finer cloths could not be weaved by angels.

Oh what a sight it is to glare upon Michael Evan Gold in all of his splendor, yes a class worth taking if only for the aestheticsGreat Professor, but this class is not for the faint of heart...You will learn more about the law than you would ever imagine.  He&#39;s extremely smart.  He talks down to you.  The assignments are impossible.  Amazing class!She&#39;s very clear and precise. make sure you pay attention in class. The cases are pretty interesting, and I thought I would hate the class but I actually enjoyed it.What can you say about Gold? Yes, it&#39;s a very demanding &amp; grueling class &amp; you will learn a lot. And yes, nothing that you could ever read or say will prepare you for the amount of work required for this class. He can be insensitive &amp; a harsh grader, but you will walk away w\/more knowledge than you ever thought possible. Take him &amp; enjoy the ride.While he might be a good professor, there is way too much work compared to the other labor law class, and the grades end up being the same.  If you want to learn and dont care about grades, then take him, if however care about your gpa and or time, think twice before signing upAmazing teacher. If you get a chance, chat with him outside of class about something besides class, you&#39;ll be suprised.Impossible assignments, but great class. He is a genius and is good at providing help to those who seek it. A must for anyone considering law school, ILR or otherwise.Griffith knows what she is talking about. You learn a lot in the class. It is very straight forward. The tests and paper are very fair. Required reading every class (if you don&#39;t do it, the class is can difficult). She encourages everyone to speak.  Recommended.Fair grader, nice lady. She and the TA were willing to help if you needed it.  My only real complaint is that she relied heavily on the class to produce the answers to our own questions, and it was sometimes hard to tell which answers were so-so, which were spot-on, etc. Not to mention that a quarter of the time you couldn&#39;t even hear the student.The class isn&#39;t easy and you will have A LOT of reading and the final paper if done properly will be A LOT of work.  However, the exams are fair and Griffith is extremely helpful, especially for those who take the time to see her in office hours.  And in the end it is still less work than Gold, but you learn just as much.","difficulty":4.5263157895,"rating":3.5263157895},{"index":3290,"prof_name":"Michael Gold","prof_dept":"Law","class_name":"ILRCB2010","comment":"So I figured I would kick off 2009 by reiterating that Professor Gold still is, in fact, moderately deranged. With that said, he is a brilliant professor and a leader in his field. I would not discourage any ILRee from taking his class. His work is tough and time consuming, but I can not criticize Gold for demanding a lot from his students.Professor Griffith was a great teacher. She was very helpful during office hours and always asked students if they had questions during class. She was always willing to further explain cases discussed in class or details went over about specific cases. I definitely reccommend her course!All you need to know is... that she does her job well.Professor Gold&#39;s course has been by far the best course I have ever taken at Cornell University.  He is a very fair professor which views students as equals, no matter their backgrounds, and challenges every student in the same manner.  I highly recommend this course.To be honest I didn&#39;t like this class. The way he taught made the class painful and if you disagreed with him he would normally just blow off your argument. He&#39;s far too opinionated.he is a great guy and amazing teacher. don&#39;t be scared to take his class. there&#39;s work, but it&#39;s definitely worth it in the end.Probably the best class I&#39;ve taken at Cornell.  I dreaded the course and Professor Gold before taking his class, and ended up loving them both.  Plan your other classes around this one though -- incredible amount of nightly work.  Gold stimulates creative thinking unlike any professor I&#39;ve had, and in the end, I view the world differently.The material is not easy for sure. Luckily, Professor Gold makes it interesting and he is fair.Best Teacher I have had in the ILR school,  Hands Down. She is very fair and interesting. Great job engaging the class. Tests are extremely fair. Awesome. Definitely take this class with this professor.Disorganized and frequently impossible to follow, she ran a 78-person class like a 12-person seminar. She happens to be really, really good at the latter format, but the into class format was borderline intolerable. Despite my justified qualms about teaching style, I learned so much, though I&#39;m not sure what that had to do with her teaching.she does a great job at introducing students to law and learning how to apply it. she gives exams for which you can cram but you must have gone to class and have done the reading. you will leave her class with the ability to read and pull out legal principles from cases, but with gold you will know much more but suffer more.","difficulty":3.8181818182,"rating":4.0909090909},{"index":3291,"prof_name":"Risa Lieberwitz","prof_dept":"Not Specified","class_name":"ILRCB201CB","comment":"Very interesting, very knowledgable, and willing to challenge you and what you say in front of the rest of class.

Boring class.Not a good teacher...at all. He made the final extremely hard for no reason. It&#39;s HR, come on! Everyones grades dropped because of it. His TAs are the absolute worst.

Avoid if you can.I love this teacher, class is so easy . . .  just make a study guide for the textbook and study the notes =)Lecture notes are mandatory for the exams. The book is useless until the night before the exam when you can go to Catherwood and make a study sheet with the outline he gives the class. The papers are annoying and useless, but not hard.

Fair exams, interesting lectures, and no busy work. Prints slides for his students. Office hours are very helpful. Really personable and cares about his students. Favorite ILR professor.Really great professor! His tests are really fair and are mostly based off of clear points from lectures. Davis always tries to make the class entertaining and provides printed slides every class. Quizzes are open book and only two out of three assignments are required. Probably the best professor you could take for this courseNot sure why he&#39;s gotten poor ratings.  He&#39;s clear, interesting and is great to look at!  Tests are very easy - just need to study notes.  Uses book very little but when he does he provides a question guide on what will be on the test from the book.  Must go to classes (for the notes)and ALL sections for full points. Extra credit is offered!I really like Prof Davis. He&#39;s super chill, extremely knowledgable, and always available to students. Highly recommend for intro to hr. Looking forward to taking classes with him in the future.Gives the trickiest multiple choice tests! Make sure you read the textbook thoroughly because she asks more than just the bolded words in the textbook. Attending lecture will also help significantly boost your grade up, especially if you participate!I had to record his lectures because he was just so hot to look at.  It was actually distracting!  No joke!  He&#39;s a good lecturer and gives information in as clear cut format as one can hope.  The course requires a bit of memorization but it is a relatively easy A as long as you study your notes.  It is strongly recommended to never miss sections!!Proudfoot is very clear about her expectations. If you do the work you will probably get an A. My one recommendation would be to read the textbook carefully. The exams get progressively more difficult. Overall, it was an interesting class and gave me a new perspective on the functions of HR.Take him!! He is so great.Very easy to follow course, with a very manageable course load. A few exams and a few easy assignments, participation in discussion is easy. He offers extra credit and the exams themselves are quite easy if you take good notes based on the study guides he provides. He&#39;s super nice and understanding, even w a boring topic! Would take againYou can&#39;t go wrong with this guy for this class. Davis is a very nice, normal guy. For a very boring topic like HR, he makes it almost bearable. His tests are pretty straightforward, and are mostly lecture with some textbook stuff. Only discussion is mandatory. There&#39;s a few easy assignments and no homework.Very easy class to get an A.  If you do the work and put in any studying for the exams you should get an A.  Professor&#39;s lectures are sometimes a little boring and repetitive, but i would definitely recommend him.Enjoyed guest speakers in class tooAs close to an easy A as you can get at Cornell, but no A+ are given, even if you get over 100% overall, which is not that hard to do. Super interesting subject matter. Tests and essays are cake if you put in even the slightest effort.Interesting lectures, but the textbook is very dense. She pulls 50\/50 from both for the 3 exams. There are 4 assignments, but only 3 are required. These are very subjective to which TA grades yours. Attendance and participation in section is mandatoryAvoid if you&#39;re a non-traditional student.  The class teaches you how to screw  employees, and if you have a previous working background, class is very difficult to follow because of the inherent experiences you take with you to class.  Pointless lectures.  No charisma.  Overall, a nice personality.  He&#39;ll give you &#34;hints&#34; in office hours.easy A. Course work is minamal. Test are multiple choice. There is always 1 or 2 Questions that appear to be unfair but she gives the statistics on how many got right and wrong to prove her case they were. Overall great class, and you actually retain material. RecommendedHe has nearly three decades of professional HR experience under his belt - more than any other professor at the school. Absolutely recommended if you are interested in entering the field. He&#39;s an excellent resource in that regard, and the class itself definitely seems geared toward those that are.With Prof. Livingston, you know exactly what you&#39;re getting.  Clear expectations for grades and most assignments, great lectures and straightforward guidelines for class success.  Very easy to get an A \u2013 just keep up on work and pay attention in lecture \u2013 exams are not difficult.

The grading is too harsh and he does not really understand East Asian labor at all. He thinks he&#39;s rather superior to his students and the people he studiesHands down one of the best professors at the ILR School. She genuinely cares about her students, is flexible, and is a great lecturer. You should take at least one class with her during your time at Cornell. You will do 5-6 case write-ups in her class and she will thoroughly read each one and give you good feedback.Does not post slides, is VERY one sided in her arguments of what she is teaching.  Grading is fair and not too difficult, biggest challenges are the two mentioned already and the mass amount of material.Talks SO fast and does not post her slides so write EVERYTHING down. She doesn&#39;t respond to emails quickly, so email her days in advance. The readings are the most helpful part of the class, but have a lot of irrelevant information, so learn how to decide what is and is not important.Great and inspirational professor who is always willing to help students, both inside and outside of class. She gives very good feedback and, although she grades a little tough, you will come out of the class with so much knowledge and will improve your writing tons.Boyer was by far the best of all the Work, Labor Capital professors. Clear with his material, and a very funny and likable guy. His test is very straight-forward, asks you questions about overall themes and patterns. If you have him for this course, you&#39;ll be pleased I&#39;m sureGood lecturer but used so many handouts and graphs that showed up on the test that it was really difficult to remember all the countries and trends which was useless and unfair. Either take really good notes or read the book for this class, don&#39;t need both. Median is a B for his prelims. Damn near everyone got a B...Givan&#39;s paper boosted the avg.too much material for one examlearnt a lotGood lecturer, one of the better ones in WLC.  Test is tough, but she makes it clear what she wants you to know, which isn&#39;t too difficultProf Batt was really helpful to me. The class was split into 4 modules. She taught the 2nd one and I had come in having struggled in the previous module. I talked to her about my problems and she helped me. I ended up being motivated by her to put alot more time into her module and as a result did better. She is also a good lecturer in-class.Great lecturer, relatively easy prelim which had a median of about a B+. If you go to his office hours he lets you know almost exactly what trends\/info you will need to study to do well on the exam. Tells terrible jokes in class, but they keep you awake and in focusProf. Adler is one of the best professors in all of ILR. He has amazing experiences to tell and truly cares about his students and the material he teaches. He may go off-topic a fair amount but only because of his enormous breadth of knowledge in literally every topic imaginable.Amazing and inspirational teacher who really knows her stuff. She is super accessible outside of class and gives very good and comprehensive feedback on her papers. She is also flexible with deadlines. She does grade assignments a little tough, but you will gan so much knowledge from the class and come out of it as a more polished writer.Good lecturer, has a hard-to-understand accent but his power points usually contain all of the necessary information and they are posted online.  Great class to satisfy international ILR requirementProfessor Gross is a completely biased individual.  He spends his entire lecture espousing his socialist ideals, urging us comrades to join him in the fight against the evil corporations. He is extremely forgetful and tends to repeat things he has already taught.  Don&#39;t ever ask him for advice on papers, he doesn&#39;t even look at them, his TA grades.Really easy to get to know. He will remember you if you participate in his class discussions. He has helped me figure out my goals both academically and personally. If you show him that you&#39;re passionate about his subject matter, he will advocate for you and score you well. The best professor in ILR in my opinion.Test is tough, but I really enjoyed listening to lectures.  Has a ton of experience and knowledge about this topic, which makes his class more interesting.Shame for Cornell to have such a professor who cannot think logically nor incorporate any quantitative data into the context, but rather only good at blaming China to appease to his masters for grants.","difficulty":3.1052631579,"rating":3.4736842105},{"index":3340,"prof_name":"George Boyer","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"ILRIC2350001","comment":"The homie Boyer was really funny and got the main idea across in each of his lectures.

Spends the whole class time trying to find different ways to call you an idiot. Doesn&#39;t seem like he is teaching economics at all.No CommentsTerrible teacher.  For one he dresses like a construction worker.  He is unclear and all over the place.  Seems to lecture from the top of his head.  Don&#39;t buy the book, he doesn&#39;t test from it at all.  He makes fun of ILR students to his higher level econ classes.  My suggestion is to go to the TA&#39;s office hours early on.  stay on top of it.I dont know what these negative comments are about. He is amazing. So smart, Jakubson, teaches to the common person. His analogy of picking up chicks in the bar and applying economic theory to it made my semester complete. TAKE LE WITH HIM!Solid class, solid (though painfully skinny) teacher. Nothing fancy here, he pretty much teaches right out of the book. But go to class, because he definitely makes the material a bit clearer than it is in the book. Nice guy. Tests were all very fair... do your part studying and you&#39;ll be fine, I got an A pretty easily.Totally awesome.Professor Smith&#39;s grading procedures are ridiculously subjective. I wouldn&#39;t recommend his class unless you like not knowing what the professor is ever looking for and enjoy re-writing your in depth term paper (compared to other professors&#39; assignments) approx. 3 times before submission and still having it scored lower than those with other profs.Prof. Smith has been very helpful and approachable in my experience.  He seems like a nice guy, but the class actually does require a little bit of work.  Once you learn the stuff, it isn&#39;t too difficult, but it does require studying his textbook.Office Hours: Gets annoyed when visited, actually called one girl an &#34;idiot&#34; for coming to office hours.

Material was not easy, but he welcome you to his office hours and helped there. He gave out practice prelims and a practice final which all were very useful. His exams reflected what he taught in class. Class attendance is a must to do well!Brilliant professor. If for no other reason, take her class because she&#39;ll be a Nobel Laureate one day and it&#39;ll be cool to say you knew her.Jakubson is one of the LE department&#39;s worst (has been there for 30 years and still has very little recognition). His lectures are terrible--he spends many of them shaming his students after a poor test, then does little to prepare students for the next one. Simply inept at explaining econ concepts and stifles classroom discussion Faculty hates himLectures arent exactly clear but they are fairly interesting. He gives out solid practice prelims for the test and curves it generously if need be. Take ILRLE 2400 with Jakubson if you actually want to learn something. The class is curved to a B+\/A-.Labor Econ. He gives PPT handouts directly from book, but also provides other info outside of book.  Weekly problem sets. 2 prelims and 1 final.  1 written assignment.  Prelims based off of problem sets. Does examples in class for problem sets, so do attend  He holds office hours for problem sets. 1st time teaching, went a little easy. Participate!This man helped me so much, beyond the classroom included. He is a genuinely caring person who wants to help his students if they come to him for help. As  teacher, he is a little loopy and can be a little frazzled-seeming, but he makes his points relatively clear. Of course, I had him over the summer so I don&#39;t know what he&#39;s like usually.Class is absolutely boring! He uses the same sayings and &#34;explanations&#34; constantly.  Answers questions with questions and useless tangents that have no relation to what the student wanted to figure out. Miserable excuse for a teacher, since he does not like to teach. Talked badly about TA too. Perfect example of the cons of tenure.During office hours, Jakubson is very helpful. During class, however, it seems as if he doesn&#39;t care at all. You either know it or you don&#39;t, and too bad for you if you don&#39;t. Additionally, his exams are ridiculously hard, and we are expected to know the material as well as he does. If you are able to, take ILRLE 2400 with a different professor.George&#39;s class is intimidating. Prelims are hard. However, if you go to office hours and show progression throughout the course its an easy A-. I almost dropped the class, but decided to stay and I couldn&#39;t be happier with the decision. Hes a great guy, quirky but runs a great class. PS  no need to buy the book, just use his hand outsGreat professor. Don&#39;t rely on the book. Go to lecture and you&#39;ll be fine. Expect to put in some work but he&#39;s very approachable in office hours.Brilliant professor. The material is challenging, but she wants students to do well and learn a lot. She writes the reading on the chalkboard at the beginning of each lecture, so if you do those and stay on top of the problem sets, you&#39;ll be fine.Professor Jakubson was an amazing professor, definitely one of my favorites. I took the course during the summer and learned so much! I recommend going to office hours. Jakubson really cares about his students and wants them to learn the material, if you show progression throughout the course you will be fine! Thanks George!Jakubson just wants his students to learn and if you put in the effort, you will absolutely get a great grade. I understood more about economics in 1 week of his class than I did from an entire semester of micro or macro econ. Do the problem sets, go to office hours, show you&#39;re making an effort, and an A+ is very possible.no, just no DO NOT TAKE labor economics with Jakubson. For someone who has taken Intermediate level economics courses at Cornell, Jakubson&#39;s Labor Economics course was a nightmare. He is disorganized, lectures are like story times, and the more he tries to take the &#34;math&#34; out of his material, more he makes the course pointless. Grading is also very arbitrary.AVOID Prof Jakubson at ALL costs. He is the WORST. He is nice if you approach him correctly. But, his class is SO hard. The lectures and textbooks are pretty much useless. Go to office hours and take the practice prelims until you memorize the answers (exactly what he doesn&#39;t want you to do) the class is impossible if you don&#39;t. Disrespectful Prof.Students who aren&#39;t that good at economics will have a difficult time in Rick&#39;s class. He&#39;s extremely smart and goes very fast, but you can easily approach him for extra help. Weekly problem sets can be challenging. His tests&#39; means\/medians normally gravitate around the 70s, but he later adjusts grades to be more fair in the end.One of the best professors I have ever had. If you show up with respect and determination George will show you mutual respect and dedication. He makes sure that everybody in class knows what is going on and is extremely personable. Makes waking up for an early class not just worth it but ENJOYABLE! I absolutely recommend taking his class.AVOID this class. He&#39;s a nice guy, but not meant for teaching. No one knows what he talks about in class, and he doesn&#39;t use slides or a textbook. Says attendance doesn&#39;t matter but passes around a sign-in sheet every class. Psets and tests also make no sense, and means fall below 50. Don&#39;t worry, the massive curve will save you. Utilize the TA.One of my favorite professors at Cornell. The topic was difficult, but Professor Jakubson is incredibly willing to help outside of class. The TA was great. He really wants you to succeed, but you have to put in work. Lectures could be a little slow and tests are hard but everything is curved up.Very helpful during OH. Prelims are straightforward. Weekly problem sets, 2 prelims, 1 final, 1 paper. Talks a bit fast and sometimes too smart for ILR students but has gotten a lot better. Very smart guy and always willing to help. Even though i don&#39;t like econ, i enjoyed and got a lot out of this classHis class is difficult, but it is fair. His lectures are really helpful and cannot be substituted by the textbook. He really gives a good understanding of basic labor economic thought and theory. I highly recommend taking his class!I was honored to have Enayati for his first labor econ course at Cornell. He&#39;s a really smart guy. Make sure to study for exams though, some of his questions seem kind of tricky, but he could&#39;ve made it a lot harder than he did. I&#39;d recommend him and would take his class again.Best professor I have had. He is extremely committed to his students and very passionate about his work. He is exceptional at helping students understand difficult concepts and is truly invested in his students&#39; performance.A great professor. He is clearly very knowledgable. There wasn&#39;t a lot of feedback regarding what you got wrong on the Problem Sets and exams, but he was very easy to get a hold of in office hours. He has a great career ahead of him. Make sure you keep up with the material and ask questions and you&#39;ll be fine. Best professor I will ever have. One of the most helpful people that you will ever meet. He is so interested in his students and their performance in his class. If you did not perform well in his class it is because you didn&#39;t make the effort to work with him. Amazing guy, VERY smart, insightful, and funny. TAKE HIS CLASS!!He is my favorite professor in all of Cornell. His class is not difficult at all and is easy to follow along. You don&#39;t have to do all the textbook readings, they just ensure you receive an A- on every quiz but these quizzes are easy to do anyway. He offers a lot of help with the research paper and wanted you to have office hours.powerpoints are awesome. but on his exams, expect the unexpected. he puts the &#39;extra-critical-thinking&#39; type questions on the exams. but still loved the class. he&#39;s HOTlooks like usher, baller in general-- usually a very clear teacher but sometimes confuses himself and the class- tests are wack but everyone ends up with an a or bHe&#39;s awesome. He so chill and lax. Sometimes he isnt really clear about the assignments or in lecture, but he is always there to answer questions. the quizzes are kind of challenging, but if you study the review q&#39;s, they wont be. Start your paper early and meet with him regularly; he will help you so much. Tests are hard but he grades generously.Professor Smith is one of the best teachers I&#39;ve had at Cornell. His class is by no means easy, but he is extremely helpful and in fact makes office hours mandatory, which was great. Exams were fair and he wrote the book so you know what he thinks is important. He&#39;s also a great and surprisingly funny person  Also counted as ILR Advanced Writing!Professor Smith genuinely cares about his students. Not only has his class taught be a lot about economics, but by meeting one of one with Professor Smith on a number of occasions I have learned a lot about life. He is easily the kindest and most sympathetic professor at Cornell. You&#39;re crazy not to take him.Easily the most accessible, friendly, and genuinely interested in this lives of his students that I have ever had at Cornell. His writing seminar is indeed extra work, but sure as hell beats all of the other ones. There are few people in this world that I respect more highly.Not an approachable teacher nor a fair grader. After going to his OH after a bad grade, he didnt offer any advice and just said that I was unlucky and do better on the next test. Also on one homework he agreed my answer was right but since it was not what the key said he gave no points back. He also lacked any empathy or understanding.I guarantee that he is one of the best professors in Cornell. Take his class if possible.Great guy.  Non-mathematical approach to labor economics is incredibly applicable to real-life scenarios.  Smith really helps students understand practical applications, rather than equations you will forget after the final.  Writing credit too!

His lecture content is organised and he his crystal clear and methodical in his delivery. He humanises the subject through personal anecdotes and real life examples. Even if you absolutely hate Economics, you MUST take his class. You&#39;re welcome. What can I say that hasn&#39;t been said? This guy is: The Man. The best professor I&#39;ve ever taken. A legend. An absolute genius when it comes to not only his field but to teaching itself. The material is not easy, even totally foreign, and he makes it crystal clear. He&#39;s also hilarious and each class is a really a pleasure.Very hard-working, fantastic professor. Expectations for the course were very clear. Presented the material in a way that made it accessible to students with no previous econ courses. He made labor econ enjoyable! Gives out copies of previous years&#39; exams, which pretty much mirrored which type of questions were asked. Excellent!Adore him and his teaching style. Got to be one of the most hard-working professors at Cornell. His lectures are organized, methodical, and crystal-clear. The amount and level of material he covers is the perfect balance between covering the essentials and stretching to keep it interesting. Exams are fair and straight-forward.Great\/best professor and super clear. He inspires and cares for  students.  Introductory labor economics class for mostly MILR and MPA students so different from usual econ undergrad courses, he doesn&#39;t focus on theory or math that much, which means course and exams are not so difficult:-)Take Fields. I&#39;m approaching my last semester at Cornell, and made sure to enroll in another of his courses before I leave. He is awesome; you won&#39;t regret taking classes with him.Best professor for international student because he is crystal-clear and almost never uses American slang.

The class (by definition) has a ton of reading and some medium length papers but she is reasonable in expectationsgrading. If in ILR, I would def recommend taking it with her. The TA was nice but a tougher grader than the Prof. There were a couple easy pop reading quizzes Salvatore is a very nice, intelligent, and interesting professor. However, his lectures are gruelingly long and boring. He gives vague essay prompts and grades moderately difficult. I did not come out of the class feeling as though I learned a whole lot.One of the kindest, most caring professors. Was extremely lenient with deadlines. Great lectures; I liked how we discussed contemporary issues like police brutality and the disproportional impact of covid on minority groups. A bit reading and writing heavy, but definitely doable and grading was fair.Professor Martinez is incredibly nice, insightful, and knowledgeable. Her lectures are presented in a way to facilitate conversation and class engagement. This would all have been wonderful if I had found any interest in the course material. There&#39;s an unrealistic amount of reading and pretty dull topics. Great teacher but boring course.Prof Martinez is a great professor! extremley kind and workload is not too bad. I would highly reccomend to take labor history with her if possibleProfessor DeVault is clearly passionate about her subject matter. However, her class had excess work as well as a final exam that other labor history classes did not have. She graded harshly and the clear expectations were not laid out prior to paper assignments.She&#39;s bubbly.DeVault is one of the nicest people I have ever met. She genuinely cares about her students. I had a class during her office hours, so she regularly scheduled other times to meet. I struggled a lot with the first essay assignment, but DeVault helped me and taught me what I did wrong. Her lectures can be dry, but the information is interesting.He is pushing the left agenda consistently, and I know this is the ILR and all, but it is ridiculous. He attributes the Great Depression to &#34;Corporate Shenanigans&#34;. His lectures often showcase his growing senility, and tend to have little correlation to our readings.There&#39;s a lot of reading and writing in the class: I remember reading (well, skimming) up to 200 pages a week. I didn&#39;t think that I was much of a historian, but she makes the material interesting. She is also open to help out if you ever need it! There&#39;s also a lot of writing for the class. I had three papers and the final was handwritten essays.His lectures can be hard to understand because he moves quickly. The trick is to write down what he has on his opening slide and use it as an outline. Once you do this, the class should be easy, and he is a really nice guy. I def recommend anyone who has to take the class to take it with him.Interesting professor who presents interesting material, but lectures had the tendency to be very dry. I appreciated that she made an effort to learn students&#39; names and was accessible for questions. There were about 2 extra credit opportunities. A lot of reading, but skimming is ok. Weekly reading quizzes during discussion section, not so bad.To date, he is my favorite professor at Cornell.  Straightforward, he tells you what he&#39;s expecting on examinations and on the paper.  A man whose vivid animation is arresting, he makes dynamic use of the lecture hall,  And if you&#39;re considering taking 2070, his teaching style is as good, if not better, than his lecture.  He&#39;s also brilliant.Awesome professor, super passionate and nice.  Lots of weekly reading with reading quizzes in discussion, but you can definitely &#34;skim&#34; main concepts and do extremely well. Two papers, go to TA office hours and you will do well on them. Extremely fair final. Some find the subject boring overall but DeVault makes it as painless as possible. Somehow takes semi-boring course content and presents it in a way that makes it the most unbearable class I&#39;ve maybe ever had. Is a nice person and is lenient with due dates but the essay prompts will make you hate your life. Better read everything or know US history well already or else you&#39;re screwedWeekly &#34;quiz&#34; on readings in discussion. Read lots of short books over the semesterOld school professor who thinks a B is a great grade. A very nice person and very willing to help if you seek him out and approach him during office hours. However, he is a tough grader and getting an A is next to impossible in his class.One of the best professors you can get at Cornell.  To be honest he is not the easiest grader, but if you take a class with him you will learn a lot about history, as well as how to really read which helps in most of your other classesProf Martinez-Matsuda is AMAZING. She is super caring and passionate about her students. There is a lot of reading in this course and the discussion sections\/pop quizzes are heavily based on these readings- at least skim! She is accommodating and will extend paper deadlines during intense parts of the semester. Take her!Grade-wise:  It all depends on your TA.  She&#39;ll give you extra time if needed for assignments, especially during the heavy part of the semester.  She really loves teaching.  The readings aren&#39;t really needed- except there are pop quizzes every once in a while, so make sure to at least skim.  Overall, I&#39;d love to take another class with her again!I&#39;m truly going to miss his class. His lectures takes a very dry subject and makes the time captivating. 2 test and and a paper. Very clear on all aspects of the class. His knowledge of the subject is second to none. If you don&#39;t take a class with him while you&#39;re here, you&#39;re truly missing out. See ya at Wedgwood Hyman.great teacher; aside from the socialistic view that she preaches subtly, she was a great instructor. if your taking us labor history, she is the best teacher to take it with hands down. class is mostly essay based but in total id say its only about 16 pages the entire semester","difficulty":2.8181818182,"rating":3.8636363636},{"index":3366,"prof_name":"Veronica Martinez-Matsuda","prof_dept":"History","class_name":"ILRLR1110","comment":"She&#39;s super sweet, like literally the sweetest person you&#39;ll ever meet.

Must be able to think critically and creatively to do well. Enjoy my time in her class even though I didn&#39;t get an A.She is a nice professor who is pretty thorough and clear with the material she presents. Reading consists of case law that you have to &#34;brief&#34; and her tests are hypothetical situations in which you have to apply cases you&#39;ve learned about. Not looking for you to do too much, which makes the exams better to navigate through. All in all, very fairProf. Lieberwitz is amazing! She is so willing to help. She will defer a lot to the TA, but she is still very involved. Definitely try to get her!!Probably the most demanding professor at Cornell and the teacher of ILR&#39;s most demanding class. He&#39;s incredibly smart and experienced.  You will learn TONS about labor law (and time management). Workload is insane, but his lectures and your knowledge at the end of the course make up for it. 2010 is great for bonding with others over lack of sleep.Gold is incredibly intense and intimidating &amp; labor law is undeniably demanding. But he is a fascinating lecturer, a fair teacher, and incredibly knowledgeable. The workload is very heavy but classmates bond over essays &amp; seemingly impossible assignments. The difficulty is worth it; I learned so much in this class. Attendance- basically mandatory.You will do well with a lot of effort, but will also do okay with very little effort. Never did any reading and still ended up with a B. Lieberwitz&#39;s ideology is very left-leaning, and only likes to give one side of every issue, but is overall a nice and passionate professor. Show up to class so you don&#39;t have to teach yourself the material.Best ILR law professor. There&#39;s a ton to study and some of the stuff you think wont be on the exams will be on there. The 1st exam is tougher and the paper is tough, but i think her final curve is strong. she&#39;s a great teacher and really sweet. do yourself a favor and take her.generally unclear grading criteria will leave you confused and disappointedIf you want to have any sort of control over your grade, take it with Griffith. Grades received in this class do not at all reflect performance.A really awesome professor who knows her stuff, and knows how to get students to learn. Made the class clear and rewarding even though i previously had no interest in law.  The research paper is pretty straight forward, and shouldn&#39;t give you trouble unless you wait until the end. And the tests are really clear, she doesn&#39;t give trick questions.What a great gal, she will answer any and every question you have during class and will slow down and review certain cases if the class seems to have trouble with it.if you want to go to law school this is life affirming. otherwise, get a different professor for labor law.  I spent all my time on this class and got an 80% which curved  to an A. Lots of group work but you can&#39;t choose your group which sucks sometimes. The Law school TA is SUPER HELPFUL, you&#39;ll learn a ton about labor law\/your writing. MeanB+worst professor in ILR. Least clear assignments, but has very specific expectations. He doesn&#39;t realize that students have other classes besides his, and you will leave each class with no idea of what to do\/how to apply the information from class.  Very smart man but awful instructor. Avoid his class at all costs.Professor Gold&#39;s class was not easy. But it was my favorite class at Cornell. You learn  a TON. He is inspiring and really dedicated to his students; I was assigned a group and we got along super well so it took some of the pressure off. He wrote my recommendation for law school and now I&#39;m a labor and employment lawyer, if that tells you anything.If you value sleep, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this prof, but if you have any interest in law you have to take it with him.  Unbelievable amount of hard work, but it pays off in the end.Most difficult class I&#39;ve ever taken in the ILR School. Labor Law took up at least 70% of my time this semester, with my other classes crammed into the other 30%. Because most of the cases are antiquated, they&#39;re a pain to read and understand. He distances himself from students and I felt intimidated to talk to him most of the semester.Hardest class I have taken so much at ILR. The material was very dry and the pop quizzes are really difficult. Don&#39;t plan on sleeping because there are often 3+ readings due every class plus homework. Papers are graded very harshly. Gold starts every class off with a joke, but someone needs to tell him that he isn&#39;t funny.Gold is a gem. You will truly learn and get your money&#39;s worth. Everyone exaggerates over how hard this class is. If you put in the work, you will succeed.Yeah, Gold is the hardest professor in ILR for the most difficult course; however, he is one of the most knowledgable professors in the school. This class will not be easy, and will require a lot of work. If you take this class, I promise you will leave it a better student. Gold is unique!Very knowledgeable, but extremely tough course. If you are going into law, take this class. If not, you will learn a lot but put in an insane amount of time and effort. If I had the option to take a different professor, I would&#39;ve because I don&#39;t want to go into law, but still glad I had this experience.Awesome prof who really cares. Sample exams show you exactly what you need to do. Classes are really helpful in highlighting the legal principles and rules that you need. Make sure you do your briefs, should be 20 minutes per lecture and will be very helpful for the exam. Generally application based class with a few specifics to know.Prof. Gold is great. His class had  a reputation for being hard as hell, but it really isn&#39;t all that bad. There is a lot of required reading and pop quizzes just about every class. Most of the homework is group work. Don&#39;t worry about his tough grading;  I had a 45% raw score at the end of the semester that got curved to a B. Learned a TON.Spunky and thoughtful. A great and fun professor and an interesting class. Not heavy on details and specifics but provides an excellent intro to legal reasoning and the general field of labor lawProfessor Griffith grades based on a prelim, legal writing assignment, and a final. She is very clear in class on how to approach the prelim and the TA is very helpful for questions about cases. Make your life easy and start the legal writing assignment when she tells you to. You don&#39;t need to read every case, but be sure you have each brief.really boring before the 1st midterm but it gets better.  She takes specific notes about your exam so you really know what to improve\/understand your grade.  very friendly and helpful and brings in amazing guest speakers. def reccommend for labor lawSuch an amazing lecturer. She explains everything so well and clearly. Definitely recommend her for labor law!Griffith was an amazing professor (definitely the best for labor law). The class is not easy but an A not impossible. You have to be on top of your work. Exams are based on class discussions; pay attention to your classmates not just Griffith.Prof Griffith is amazing - always makes sure her students are clear and understand the material. 2 exams one paper. Make sure you take really good notes in class, study, and you&#39;ll do great. But, if you miss something or are unclear, make sure you ask questions!! Would recommend wish I could take anther class with her!She is overrated on here because the other professors teaching labor law are unbearable. Her class is significantly more work than other labor law professors due to the in class tests. She is a fair and reasonable person and doesn&#39;t have the elitist superiority many other professors do. There are pros and cons to her course, weigh them and decide.Great professor. I didn&#39;t have any interest in labor law but this class was one of best classes I&#39;ve taken. It was also the toughest class but you&#39;ll be fine if you pay attention in class, take good notes and work for it. Go to office hours if you have questions and show your efforts to the professor and TA. Recommend taking any of her class.Prof Griffith is a spectacular teacher. She clarified all of the course material and clearly explained the expectations for the course. 2 tests and 1 legal research assignment. You need to be in every class because EVERYTHING is fair game for tests. Tests are pretty difficult, but she does give the course a curve and that worked to my benefit.","difficulty":3.9032258065,"rating":3.9677419355},{"index":3368,"prof_name":"Alexander Colvin","prof_dept":"Law","class_name":"ILRLR2040","comment":"Great professor and great class.

Mock bargaining isn&#39;t really that bad, just need a decent group who cares. Other than that, it&#39;s a pretty straight forward class that is very doable.The grading is completely arbitrary.

The course is horrifically boring. Mock bargaining exercises are especially painful (doubly so when you&#39;re grouped with morons, as I was). The class is easy, at least.Very interesting material. Tests were curved a lot so easy A.Prof Katz is the best. The only thing that&#39;s hard is the assignments are graded by TAs who grade harshly. Lectures are actually really interesting and the tests are extremely fair. The way he handled online class was probably the best approach, you just watch a video lecture and don&#39;t have to even go to the zoom unless you want more clarification.Class is graded based on one prelim, a bargaining simulation, and a final. The lectures are interesting, but you won&#39;t know what to expect from the prelim and the final. The bargaining simulation is a great experience, make sure you prepare well for it though.Work hard on the bargaining simulation and study for the tests and you will definitely get an A. Litwin struggled a little bit with a large class in a big lecture hall but is a very smart and nice guy. None of the content is difficult and he does his best to make it engaging. Never opened the textbook and definitely didn&#39;t need it.You will not really have any idea what is going on throughout the course until the tests come around. That being said, everything works out as long as you participate and study the slides a bit. Hilarious guy but leads a super disorganized class that should be split up into smaller sections. Extremely generous grading.He seems very nice and chill and knowledgable but the TA&#39;s are the ones doing the grading and they&#39;re HARSH. there are several papers and a project but he lets you work in partners or groups of 3 so its more manageable. The assignments seem simple but again, they grade harshly so beware. The tests are very fair though :)Attedance is mandatory - enforced through iClicker and in-class exercises on Canvas Assignments\/Exams are not easy but are graded very generously Lecture was 300ish people - way too big, so low engagement with most students. Litwin is very knowledgable, a great professor, and a really great guy, but this class should be taught in a smaller settingOne of the best professors at CornellLitwin is probably the worst Professor Ive encountered at Cornell. Classes are disorganized-we randomly fly though assignments, and exam is so out of left field you wont know what hit you. Professor trys to be funny and engaging, but instead wastes time with pointless things like passing the cube or playing abruptly playing kahoot. Dont take.Ariel Avgar is an incredibly knowledgeable and engaging Professor. He is very helpful in office hours. Labor Relations can be dry at times but he made the class worth while. Overall great guy.Cares about his students, but the class was often very boring.Katz is cool and you can tell he cares about his students. He&#39;s pretty laid back, but the TAs are VERY harsh graders and papers require super specific verbiage, so watch out for that. Exams are fair. Watch the prerecorded video lectures and follow the discussions about the movies\/case studies and you&#39;ll be fine.Also worst class\/professor for me. He started out strong, with funny dad jokes and an interactive classroom setup (cube). Lectures got boring quick. Extremely disorganized and no guidance for big bargaining simulation. Showed his own videos instead of lecturing. Take it with Katz or ANYONE else. Interesting content - needs to be taught better.His class is the best introduction to labor relations!

I wish more professors mimicked his style.  He is very down to earth and has the best lectures I&#39;ve ever attended!  The first test is all about definitions (they&#39;ll tell you this) that can be found in the text.  Much of the grade is based on debate participation.Sam is a really funny and caring guy; favorite professor I&#39;ve had so far. Made lectures really interesting and worth going to, despite it being a night class. Tests are 50% lecture, 50% book details, so lectures are definitely necessary, as is the book. Discussion is kinda boring; don&#39;t take early in the morning. Overall, great class. 9.8\/10.He is an entertaining lecturer, and highly recommend taking the debate class if it satisfies requirements. This class will also make you a better public speaker.Nelson is a weird professor and you will need to adapt to his interesting style. You HAVE to read the textbook. A lot of students made the mistake of glossing over it and not performing well. Also, make sure you go over EVERYTHING from the lectures. He asked for quotes on the final without warning. Everything is fair game.His debate class is easy and he is just such an amazing human being. I would definitely recommend anyone to take the class!Sam is a great person and is easy to talk to but I didn&#39;t actually enjoy this class like I expected to. I don&#39;t feel that I learned much or that my debate skills improved. Lectures were full of tangents and stories, so some classes will be more important than others. Tests were definitely curved.Sam is, by far, the best teacher I&#39;ve ever had. I had him for my ILRLR 3300 3-week summer program and it was undoubtedly the highlight of my summer. He&#39;s super funny, super friendly, and super knowledgeable. He gives lots of lectures but they&#39;re always fantastic.  I visited him a lot during my course and even met with him at CTB. He&#39;s a true gem.","difficulty":2.5714285714,"rating":4.5714285714},{"index":3380,"prof_name":"Nick Salvatore","prof_dept":"History","class_name":"ILRLR3860","comment":"I&#39;ll say it like how it is.

He does none of his own grading, instead leaving you at the mercy of TA&#39;s. He doesn&#39;t even review it. If you want to contest the grade you may get worse. He&#39;s too full of himself to be an assistant professor. I&#39;d pass on this class.Not at all helpful in office hours. Avoid!!!!Um, what?  He lectures from his book.  Literally, his lectures are just him reading from his book most of the time, with side comments here and there.  The class in general is a little dry and boring.  At times, it does get interesting though.  He tries to push his political agenda too much and depending on which TA you have it&#39;s hit or miss.As the leading professor in his field, lectures\/topics covered were great. Can get dry at times, but you will come out having learned many new things. On the flip side, he can be super witty and fun to watch lecture. He seems to care about students&#39; learning outcomes and makes it clear what expects on prelims.Louis R. Hyman has &#39;It&#39;  That&#39;s all you need to know.Professor Hyman is truly amazing. I had him for class this past fall and he has clear expectations\/grading and as long you put in the effort, you will do well. Assigns a good amount of reading but doesn&#39;t expect you to read everything word for word.

She isn&#39;t very kind, and seems to expect near-perfection.  However, the classes she teaches are extraordinarily useful.  Take if passionate about material; otherwise DON&#39;T.Without a doubt the most important labor-focused professor in the ILR School.

Clear grading and evaluates in a variety of ways, so fair grading. Best, she&#39;s nice and down-to-earth. Wants students to like subject as much as she. One of my favs.One of the worst professors I&#39;ve had in my entire life.   Her lectures consist of her reading straight off of her overly wordy powerpoint slides. Her tests are unbelievably poorly written and the grading policies are unclear.Overall she is a very good lecturer and a nice person who wants to help her students. The only real complaint I have about the class was that there was lots of busywork.Extremely intelligent and well spoken professor, especially for someone so young.  Makes lectures interesting and none of the assignments in the class are too difficult.  Study the slides and book for the prelims and you&#39;ll get an ACrystal-clear lecturer and incredibly smart woman. She tells you what she expects and goes over everything you need to know in class. TAs tend to be decent and are able to answer many questions.  A few papers, one prelim, one final, group project.  Many assignments are time-consuming, but not necessarily difficult if you pay attention.Amazing teacher! Lectures go fast but the slides are posted online so dont worry. Very kind teacher and willing to meet wth students. Best class i have taken at Cornell. Interesting and interactive!! Would recommendTHE BEST PROFESSOR. If you have him, make an effort to get to know him outside or class. He is very encouraging and invested in your success. Such a great lecturer, so organized, and so good at teaching. This is my favorite and most useful class I&#39;ve taken so far. I learned so much that I applied to my actual life. A gem of a professor.He is very passionate and an amazing lecturer. He is also an incredibly considerate person. The TAs were horrible and he increased one of my essay grades by over a letter grade after I talked to him. Textbook can easily be found online for free and grade is split over several large assignments. Put in a good amount of work and you will get an A.BEST PROFESSOR TAKE HIS OB CLASS. He was by far by favorite professor my first semester at Cornell. He incorporates videos into his lectures and they are very very very interesting. The workload is not so heavy there is 3 exams and 2 papers. RISSING IS THE MAN!!!!!!!!!!He is so good, especially the flow of the course during the COVID. My only prof that I would say manages time well. Designs perfectly the discussions.Rissing is one of the best teachers I&#39;ve ever had. Being incredibly well-spoken and organized, everything he presented in lecture made sense and was easily comprehensible. Very interesting subject matter as well. I can&#39;t overstate how good of a professor he is - the effectiveness of his teaching was incredible.Professor Rissing is awesome, he made this course an incredible experience. He was so understanding of everything especially in a virtual format. His lectures are enjoyable and informative and he is very clear about what you need to do on tests and grading criteria for papers. All in all, awesome content with an awesome profThis is an amazing class. I thought the content was so interesting that I didn&#39;t even mind memorizing it all for the tests, which is, in fact, all you have to do to get a good grade. Lucas won&#39;t inspire you in his delivery, but he teaches the material well. Study the lecture slides and skim the textbook.Lucas is a very good teacher who has very engaging lectures. Going to lectures is helpful as the tests lean more on stuff in class than reading. The course content is extremely interesting. Lucas also allows for a lot of extra credit opportunities. One note is that the tests are more conceptual and situational questions not just straight factsWeekly section with mandatory attendance and a group project.It&#39;s always great when you have a professor who really understands the subject and has a clear passion and desire to teach students. Dr. Zitek was very professional and made sure that expectations were made very clear. Make sure you study for exams because the test questions can get rather tricky if you aren&#39;t 100% comfortable with the informationReally liked her class. Lecture can be boring sometimes, but she tries to make it interesting. She knows the course material very well and is super helpful during office hours. No final, 3 prelims (all multiple choices). Get the textbook for assignments and prelims and attend lectures for iclicker points. Prelims are not too bad if you studyBoring class. Tests are very tricky with questions based off the most minute details from the reading. Not enjoyable at all.Professor Zitkek is an accomplished researcher and good lecturer. Organizational Behavior is a very straight forward class - it&#39;s like putting names and definitions to situations in the workplace which you already are familiar with. There are a few extra credit opportunities. Read the textbook and prepare for the tests a more than a night before.One of the nicest professors I&#39;ve had at Cornell. She&#39;s serious, but also really helpful. If you&#39;re feeling confused about something, just go to her office hours.Emily is awesome! Really, deeply cares about her students. And I learned a lot from the class I took with herOB is interesting but Professor Lucas was an average lecturerOne of the best lecturers I&#39;ve had during my time at Cornell. Always put together, somehow basically memorizes the slides and effortlessly relays the information. Has had an incredibly accomplished and interesting life despite being only like 30 years old.

I read his text book and understand it.  I do well on the homework.  His tests, on the other hand, are worded so terribly that nobody can understand the answers - even the TA&#39;s.What a duesche.  He parades around the room with a fannypack like a Peter Pan character.  His tests are the most confusing exams I&#39;ve ever taken in my life and have no correlation with the wordy &#34;textbook&#34; he wrote.This is the hardest classes at Cornell to do well in- you can know the material cold and lose A LOT of points on prelims- the professor is the worst teacher (college or HS) I have ever had and my grasp of the concepts is slim to none because of him.No CommentsIt&#39;s extremely frustrating to be in his class. His lectures are a complete waste of time, but we students and TAs usually don&#39;t get the information needed to complete the assignments. He&#39;s not very nice to approach either, very condescending or defensive.The thing with velleman is he&#39;s intereresting on somedays but he just zones out somedays and lectures with a weird attitude. he&#39;s pretty approachable in my opinion so I don&#39;t know why the bad reviews. he made his test as easy as it could have been- you just gotta do the homework\/ go to lecture a lilHis book was trash. His computer program was worse. In ST211, Wells had to re-teach everything. This man should not be a college professor.I don&#39;t really understand why everyone is complaining. It&#39;s not the best subject, but he presents the material clearly enough, and the tests aren&#39;t that damm difficult to understand, I think he gives a lot of easy points. My TA is an idiot though.Hates students and is impossible to understand.  If you have to take Stats 210 wait and take it in the spring when someone else teaches it.I had this guy back when he was writing IntroStats - he actually tried to hold class on 9-11. This guy is a piece of work. Most self absorbed **** who ever taught. Lectures were weak and his trash work in progress was heavily litered with mistakes. Got to ILRST211 and Wells wondered what the hell we did the previous semester. Velleman has a Napolean complex and only cares about writing his book.Really boring class.  Lecture is the same as the book.  Waste of time. TAs are sometimes hot.No really bash him, he is a horrible teacher.  He is boring and can&#39;t write tests to save his life.  He makes us do all these numerical problems for homework and then makes his tests all tricky word questions (with no numbers or calculations).  I thought stats was about numbers?!he teaches this class by acting out statistics like that of an actor. tries to make it fun and really does grade in your favor. I had an awesome TA which helped. you get to use cheat sheets on the tests!Professor Karns is so awesome. She presents the information in an interesting way and is extraordinarily helpful. Aside from that she is a fascinating individual. I never thought statistics could be this much fun.I had a favorable opinion of this class until taking the final, which was probably the worst test I have ever taken in my life. Intentionally misleading tests aside, he is a clear and interesting lecturer. At the very least, his wardrobe is entertaining.If you like boring lectures taught by a professor who is full of himself and his beloved textbook, which is poorly written to say the least, take this class. Oh, almost forgot to mention that his computer program is useless.Read the textbook, it&#39;s easy to understand. You can go to lecture to substitute for the reading or just go to class and forget the textbook. His tests are deceiving, but they test you on the application of Stats, not if you can actually do the math. Overally, it&#39;s a useful class that doesn&#39;t require much work.I think a lot of the people who posted here are  just angry because they did poorly in his class. Come on guys--just because you didn&#39;t get an &#34;A&#34; doesn&#39;t make the professor bad.  In reality, Velleman&#39;s class is pretty easy and he&#39;s a nice guy if you actually ask him a question. His class is a little unorthodox in that he&#39;s taken out the math.Wow.  This is the only professor in ILR who could possibly be more in love with himself than Haas.  With his belt and shirt buttons not aligned properly and the waist and inseam sticker still on his jeans, this man will spend 45 minutes trying to convince you of the importance of this crap rather than actually teaching it.  Read the textbook.No CommentsThe material isn&#39;t that hard, but I really didn&#39;t understand it until I read the book.  His lectures kind of confused me.he LOVES himself and the textbook he wrote.  he also loves activstats so you definitely have to learn to use it for hws.  you don&#39;t have to go to lecture if you read the textbook and do the activstats.  prelims are short and you get to bring cheatsheets.","difficulty":3.0384615385,"rating":2.1923076923},{"index":3415,"prof_name":"Marty Wells","prof_dept":"Mathematics","class_name":"ILRST2100","comment":"my class was very big, and half the class was absent everyday, except review days. he is boring but read the book and do the problem sets with care. you&#39;ll be fine. go to discussions. make use of the &#34;view an example&#34; button in coursecompass. this will help you do the hwPromises to be &#34;your statistician for life&#34; but ends up talking down to students and using the class to inflate his own ego.

Take another professor if you really wanna learn statsI&#39;ve never heard of having to do papers in a math class but we have almost weekly papers on concepts he hasn&#39;t even taught yetEasily one of the best (ILR) professors out there. The way he teaches eliminates the need for traditional math or calculations, and instead, requires you to critically think and understand data. He&#39;s exceptionally smart, but very approachable. Tests are fair, but can be tricky; grades are curved at the end.Fine at best. He is disgustingly arrogant. However, if you can get past his ego he is more concerned that you understand statistics overall opposed to just the math behind it, which is good. Some days he can be very boring. Tests are fair and papers (yes papers, quite a few of them) are not terrible at all. Overall not terrible but not enjoyable.Takes all the math out of statistics, which has its positives and negatives. Weekly homework and various different assignments required. Tests are tough and require a large amount of critical thinking. Class can be painfully boring at times. Best part of the class is the textbook which Professor Velleman wrote himself. Easy textbook to read.Velleman is an excellent teacher. I actually enjoyed reading the textbook (which he wrote), due to its conversational style and interesting examples. He posts all his lectures online, so attendance is not mandatory. If you choose not to go, you should still watch the lecture videos - they help with the homework.Good professor.Velleman is an all-around genius. He&#39;s a smart, lively, and engaging lecturer, very willing to talk to students.I swear nobody understood anything during lecture. She would breeze over concepts that left me feeling more confused about life after each session.The professor is an epic fail.\n \n His exams are ridiculously cryptic and deceiving, his demeanour is arrogant and obnoxious, his wardrobe is from another decade, his Activ Stats is as hackeyed as his outfits, his lectures are equally uninforming and what else can I say?\n \n Try taking PAM or AP stats instead.I was amazed that someone could have such a large ego. He acts like he&#39;s too good for an intro to stats course, but I think he only teaches it since he gets to sell his textbook to all his students. It&#39;s a lousy textbook with many typos and every student pays $130 that goes right to his pocketAlthough information is very dull, he interjects with funny comments. Really easy course if you want to fulfill a math requirement. Didn&#39;t feel like I learned much though. Assignments include short weekly homework assignments, a take-home midterm and a take-home final. Go to lecture and office hours and you will get an A.Prof. Karns would go over previous lectures if she felt like we, as a class, didn&#39;t quite understand the concept. The exams were ALL MULTIPLE CHOICE and quite easy. The best way to get an A in this class is to go to most of the lectures and practice some problems. This has to be the easiest stats class at Cornell! Would I recommend: UM, YES!Rude professor. Passive aggressive. Does not care about her students. Not technologically savvy. I am very disappointed to have her as my professor and I think that she is a poor reflection of what Cornell professors should be like.My god they need some better ilr stats teachers. Easy class but she&#39;s kind of an awful person, super rude to TAs as well. Explicitly said she&#39;s only at cornell to do research so don&#39;t expect her to care about intro classes. Soooo many spelling and conceptual errors on her tests and you have to fight for the points back. If not in ILR don&#39;t take.Concepts are presented very clearly and assignments are given to increase understanding. Exams are very fair and you can makes notes sheets to bring into the prelims\/final. The grading scheme is very clear so you can keep track of how you&#39;re doing. You don&#39;t do math and its easy to do well. She does not give out out A+ grades thoughHe gives you notes that you could print out and follow the lecture with. These notes are exactly what I used for the exams and scored the mean or above. The class is not hard at all. I would recommend you go to . every class so that you don&#39;t fall behind.This site doesn&#39;t let me swear because lol I wrote a scathing review before this. Just know that taking her class is tough man, its really tough. Bad situation to be in. She is a terrible teacher, you won&#39;t learn a whole lot of stats I promise you. Peace.Karns is not accommodating, strict. No powerpoints in class instead she talks most of the time where we only see her face. Material is taught before class in pre-lecture powerpoint videos and not gone over really during lecture. The grading scale causes for much stress as there are no prelims but many quizzes where you can&#39;t review your answers.Don&#39;t take statistics with Kevin Packard. Go with the other professor. Lecture notes are a bit hard to follow, his handwriting is hard to read, and he talks about formulas that are never needed. You never feel ready for the tests. Ever. If you want a B- or B, take this class. If you want an A or A+, take the other professor.DO NOT take ILRST2100 with Packard. He cares little about the well-being of his students and made the class unnecessarily hard. The other professor is much better, and her class average was an A, while ours was a C. His tests were impossible and his office hours didn&#39;t help at all. If you value your GPA and mental health, avoid at all costs.Statistics is a dry subject. That said, I found that Packard made a real attempt to keep lectures interesting. He provides detailed notes that you&#39;re able to print out and fill in during lecture. The class was more math heavy than other sections; if you like math take it with him. I found him to be accessible and friendly.   PS - Cornell&#39;s hard.Professor wants to see students succeed.  The tests are multiple choice and pretty straight forward.  She is helpful.  Did not find TAs useful though.If you want to watch an awkward white guy talk about graphs and statistics this is the class for you. While his awkwardness in and of itself is pretty funny if you like the absurd, its not that great for learning and makes it that much harder to learn.Karns isn&#39;t that smart, but she knows her statistics.  The class really doesn&#39;t get very technical at all, but her tests are so easy.  My only gripe is she only gives A+&#39;s to people above 100 in the class.Cares a lot about students and is willing to meet so much outside of class to help you get it. I really appreciated how much he goes above and beyond in meeting with students. Class is not hard if you make the effort and meet with him.Lectures could feel a bit rambly and long. The homework wasn&#39;t a representative sample of the types of questions on exams, so exams could feel unfamiliar to some. (Also, if you&#39;re also an engineer, I wouldn&#39;t recommend taking this course if you want to learn more than very basic stats)Professor Packard is one of the best professors I&#39;ve ever had. He shows up everyday with incredible enthusiasm for teaching, which makes learning a lot easier. He offers office hours everyday, so if you are struggling he is more than willing to help you out. Not only is he a great professor, but he is one of the nicest people I&#39;ve ever met.I found the book to be much more clear than his lectures. The homework and practice prelims are helpful for preparing for the prelims and final. Participation grades are taken throughout the semester based on group assignments in class and discussion sections.Stats is an inherently boring subject, at least from my perspective. Students in ILR Stats are usually not math geniuses, and thus, the class may actually be challenging for those who are more humanities-inclined. That being said, Packard is an absolutely fantastic translator of the material, and his compassion and genuine kindness are evident.Packard is nice guy who is excited to teach. He tends to teach stuff in lecture you won&#39;t really need, like proving formulas, and the weekly hws are very tedious. However, ILR kids tend to not be good at math (even stats), so the curve will likely bring you to an A if you can average at least a 90. The tests are very similar to the practice tests.She makes NO sense during lecture. I went to lecture every single time and her lectures were hard to follow, especially when she stopped using the powerpoints. She seemed to confuse herself and couldn&#39;t even perform some basic math operations. I learned more in section, from the book, and the online problem sets.I have no idea how she taught this course before this semester, but I can tell that she did a horrible job this spring. She made no sense during lectures, just read the slides out loud. But what makes this course unbearable is that the 3rd prelim turned out to be a nightmare for both the TAs and the students.She is an alright professor who conveys fairly simple concepts. Exams are more than fair. She genuinely wants students to do well and gives lots of chances. Not a difficult class at all.She doesn&#39;t know how to communicate, is rude, and expects you to teach yourself. If you want to be stressed out and up late trying to figure out the directions for an assignment even after asking her a multitude of questions about it, then this is the class for you! If not then I would highly suggest taking a course w\/a professor who communicatesI learned literally nothing from this class. Stats is supposed to be a math class and somehow we were only tested on random irrelevant concepts found in the book. Stats is a pretty important subject, used in most fields so even if another stats is harder, I recommend taking that class instead.Karns has been the MOST frustrating professor. She makes many mistakes with grading and writing questions with appropriate answers, which is fine, but she doesn&#39;t take accountability. Fought her on a test question for weeks before she realized she was wrong. All the points I have lost in the class is because of her incompetence.Professor Karns truly cares about all of her students. She wants all of her students to succeed. She teaches in a way that makes statistics easy to understandKarn&#39;s is one of the nicest professors I&#39;ve had but she reads off the slides word for word and has no idea how to help you if you come to her outside of class and tell her that you&#39;re confused. The class is only easy for non-ILR kids who were too lazy to take a real math class so be prepared to struggle if you&#39;re not already great at statisticsKarns is clear and concise when it comes to teaching statistics. However, she is genuinely one of the meanest professors I&#39;ve met. She doesn&#39;t show anyone respect. Not the students, not the TAs. She&#39;s passive-aggressive for literally no reason.Solid class. Never needed textbook. Homework problems assigned but not mandatory\/necessary. Allowed to bring two pages of cheat sheets to exam. Boring lectures but doable exams.Really easy A- course, but can&#39;t do much better than that. Only 30 multiple choice questions per exam so misread 2 questions per exam and say good bye to your A.Easy stats class. Trust me when I say to read ahead of time and do practice problems BEFORE the lecture. She can go fast but if you read before lecture then the entire class will be a breeze. Her lectures are clear. Seriously read and do practice problems ahead of time and ask questions when you need to and she will give you that A.Worst professor I have ever had. She does not care if you fail. She does not care if you are confused or struggling. She is extremely disinterested and rude. I was excited for statistics and she completely ruined my experience with it. The worst experience I have ever had with a professor. Please, if you can, do not take her class.Why do I need over a 95 for an A...???Professor Karns genuinely cares about her students. If you study, you will do well. She serves as a role  model to all other professors at Cornell.Professor Karns is very good at teaching statistics and making it about as easy as possible for everyone to do pretty well. However, her grading criteria is slightly confusing and a 95% (out of 100 with little to no extra credit) is required to receive an A.This professor does an excellent job at teaching the material and making it easy to understand. That said, she makes constant errors with grading which become frustrating very quickly.  Additionally, she comes off as an extremely rude and uncaring individual, who has absolutely no interest in interacting with her students.","difficulty":3.1509433962,"rating":2.8867924528},{"index":3416,"prof_name":"Tom Diciccio","prof_dept":"Mathematics","class_name":"ILRST211","comment":"Curves so that over half the class gets A&#39;s and class is open-book.

Great at explaining things further. Loves people who ask questions and are generally interested in the topic.He is a stickler about attendance (takes it every lecture) which sucks for an early morning class, but you can tell he wants us to actually learn the material he teaches. The projects are straightforward and you really get a good grasp of the material. Plus he was super understanding of a personal situation of mine and that meant a lot to me.Professor Kyle Harms did really well for his first semester at Cornell. He really spends time explaining concepts to students and does not skip over steps. He did a lot of live demos at class. He also had the class do engaging activities. Maybe use clickers next semester for attendance.Kyle is a very motivated and focused professor, it&#39;s clear that he cares a lot about his students learning the skills behind the material that he teaches. However, as a result, there ends up being a large amount of work with strict grading guidelines with minimal leeway. But if you stay on top of everything you will gain practical skills.Kyle is an easy professor grading-wise, which is great. Despite this, the class holds your hand way too much. Design journeys are brutal. Easy A though.Tanzeem is not a skilled professor. She drones off the powerpoints, cannot engage the class, and does not demo code in class. Do not expect anything out of lecture. The course, however, is project-based, and textbooks are rad. Read them, you will learn a lot.Easy easy class. Projects can be frustratingly tedious but not difficult. Final exam tested basics and nothing more. Attendance is taken at both lecture and section but you&#39;re given a good amount of slip days. Harms is good at explaining things and very willing to help. Class meant for beginners so it can feel a bit slow if you have cs experience.I&#39;ve taken INFO 1300, 2300, and 4340 with Kyle. He is extremely knowledgable, and is very dedicated to making sure his students learn the material. This dedication informs all of his course policies and teaching methods  but as a consequence he is strict with the rules. Follow his rules to the letter and you will do well and learn a lot.Take a class with her! She is passionate about web design, knew what she was talking about, and taught well. She can be quirky at times but is extremely approachable and will take the time to explain concepts to you, no matter how long it takes. She makes jokes in class and is a genuinely nice and cool person. Best prof in the IS dept.Fun projects! Kyle does care about students&#39; success and offers a loooot of help if you request for them in class. He tried to make his class a warm community.Lectures were deadly, your grade is basically made up entirely by the final project and the course was structured horribly.Tanzeem is very passionate about web design. Her class was interesting, although at times I felt that it lacked a clear direction.  It is a project based course, and was very educational and useful. Her experience in the emerging  field of mobile development was shared with the class. There was lack ofa clear grading system and syllabus.

If I studied for more than a few hours before each prelim, I would&#39;ve done better. Final is noncumulative.I liked INFO 2450 with Professor Margolin for the most part. The assignments gave you a lot of time to complete. He is a good lecturer at class when explaining concepts; however, some of his test questions are unnecessarily confusing. The exams could have been designed better to test the taught materials.Engaging professor, does a good job explaining things. Tests aren&#39;t hard if you put in the effort, mostly just understanding vocabulary and coming up with your own examples. Writing assignments are easy A&#39;s if you clearly follow the guidelines. 1 video project, again easy A if you put in the effort.

The HWs were often frustrating and confusing, but the course staff was super helpful, so in the end it gets done. The course could be better organized, but mainly just want to say how great of a guy Mimno is. Truly cares about his students, understanding with deadlinesGrade is mostly based on problem sets and exams. Ginsparg is really brilliant and cares a lot about the students. The problem sets can be difficult but the TAs are usually helpful.The lectures are exquisite, projects are well defined, and grading fair as a dove. When I first entered the class I was a small Caterpillar. This class was the chrysalis that transformed me (and preprocessed me lol) into a beautiful butterfly in a random forest.Very arrogant, unhelpful  professor. He is extremely unfriendly and hostile to students who have extenuating circumstances. (i.e., being sick, missing a few classes) He is also extremely disorganized and his notes are close to impossible to understand.Very good lecturer, sometimes makes good jokes. Psets can take a while.

Her attitude makes it difficult to ask for helpINFO 3450 is a great and rewarding class but warning, it is time consuming. You will have to put in lots of effort, but in the end you should have a project  you can talk about in job interviews.   Gilly is a great, respectable prof. You can tell she puts in a lot of time and attention to her lectures which are always easy to read later on.The professor tried to control students a lot. No phone and no laptop during the speech (are we elementary students?) The grading criteria is also confusing and doesn&#39;t reflect our efforts.Lectures were uninformative, straight from the textbook, and nobody paid attention. Group activities took up half of lecture and were not helpful at all. Grading &#34;rubrics&#34; were ambiguous at best. Grading is done by TAs. Some gave straight 100s while other students were failing assignments for comparable work. Poorly organized class.Surprisingly well spoken teacher. I really enjoyed the class and it wasn&#39;t too tough. I usually give teachers low marks on this site, but I truly give danco a 5\/5. He&#39;s so personable - it&#39;s almost as if he was a student here as opposed to a teacher. Highly recommend this class \/ teacherAll projects  make your final grade. Not difficult but tedious work. Course concept is good but not &#34;inspirational.&#34; Prof has a reputation. Quite nice in person but different on Piazza. Vague grading criteria make student furiously frustrated. Info UX major? No choice + take it, save time for later projects,move on. COMM major just looking? Hmm.Francois gives you a lot of room to really apply the material in class, and is ready to sit down with your group to work out the kinks if you take the time. I think it&#39;s pretty clear that he&#39;s passionate about design and that helps make the lectures more interesting to me. If you just make sure to follow the bookblackboard, it&#39;s easy to do well.Lectures are boring, but since there is an attendance grade, just show up and do other work on your laptop. She&#39;s fairly nice, but not the best lecturer, if only because the material is boring and straightforward. Work on the assignments and group project and you&#39;ll be fine.Each class has an attendance activity. Show up, mess around on your laptop, and it. No need to pay attention to the lecture.

You need to play by her rules and no room to be creative.The worst class and professor I have ever had here at Cornell in my three years.  No grading rubrics makes the class extremely confusing.

Nut up or shut up.Professor Leshed does a good job with the Online Communities Course.  Be forewarned it is fairly repetitive of other Info\/Comm classes.

If you do not like group work, this is NOT the class for you.This course is extremely intensive for very little payoff.

Professor Wittlesbach cares about her students both inside and outside the classroom. She has been one of the nicest Professors I have met at Cornell. Definitely take!Professoressa von Wittelsbach is one of the most caring, compassionate, and kind people you&#39;ll have teaching you. During covid, she was always ready to be flexible and understand that we might need more time to finish assignments. Her lectures were also always interesting and given with humour and wit! TAKE her class!!There really is no reason not to take this class. Profesoressa is funny, smart, and really cares about her students. If you show up, do the readings, and be respectful, youll do well.Professor von Wittelsbach is amazing! Every class is interesting, and you not only learn about Jewish Italian Lit and writing, but also about culture and life. This class helped me become well-rounded and to stand out in job interviews. Although the class isnt easy, the workload is manageable and her grading is very fair.Professor von Wittelsbach was an amazing professor in my FWS ITAL1113. I highly recommend taking her FWS as you not only learn a lot about the course material but Professor von Wittelsbach is simply a well of knowledge who is ready to share her brilliance with you at any time. You simply have to ask.Professor von Wittelsbach truly cares not only about her students&#39; learning, but also their well-being. She&#39;s very understanding if you need an extension, let alone being an excellent teacher. She&#39;s really funny and makes the class feel like a mix of shabby-chic and professionalism (you have to have her if you wanna know what I mean).FRESHMEN, TAKE THIS FWS!!! One of the most interesting classes I took my freshman year. Professor von Wittlesbach is so knowledgeable, and I could have listened to her talk about anything. A great mix of reading, movies, and guest lecturers. You learn essay, email, and fiction writing.

You must utilize your time well and actually put some effort into this class in order to do well.  The concepts aren&#39;t too hard to grasp and he is always willing to help you out if you don&#39;t understand the content.  I recommend taking Jakubson although you must know your basic algebra.professor smith is by far my favorite prof that ive had at cornell. he is extremely nice and extremely helpful. he seems to genuinely want to help his students learn. the lectures themselves were interesting because it wasnt just straight econ, he mixed in practical applications of what we were learning. overall i would say he is the man.Subjective, but helpful. The trick is, his help is worthless. May give you pages of feedback on your paper then a poor grade. Lectures are incredibly boring, and poorly organized. If you don&#39;t like the lectures, the book is worse since it is written by him.He is very knowledgable and a very engagin lecturer. Give him a chance and ignore the silly ratings left by the few unfortunates who are too retarded to understanted basic economic concepts. He gives you solid practice exams and throws a nice curve on the grades if need be. Utilyze office hours if you are confused...he likes explaining thingsHe is actually really nice and only rude when someone deserves it.  HOWEVER, I agree that the question of what to study is extremely unclear:  you don&#39;t want to waste your time druding through that boring textbook, but at the same time his class lectures are scattered in their material and it&#39;s impossible to to tell which concepts are important.Avoid! Avoid! Spends the majority of the class period making students feel stupid...Does not use the text...This class has given me a huge headache. It is not worth your time.No outline of what is expected in class or on testsRudest guy ever. He explains things to you like you&#39;re an idiot. Even more unhelpful in office hours. Definitely does NOT stick to the syllabus, he changes what you&#39;ll be graded on after every prelim. Overall, is very knowledgeable but CANNOT teach to save his life.Jakubson&#39;s an excellent professor with a sense of humor and a passion for economics.

VERY harsh grader, will make u think you&#39;re stupid.  Despite getting a raw 78% in the class, I ended with an A. Get on his good side;)He is a really great professor. He&#39;s very kind and extremely knowledgeable in the subject. He gives great advice on your writing, grades fairly, and has interesting lectures. He genuinely cares about his students, and he also has a good sense of humor. I would definitely take a class with him again.The professor is generally rude and unpleasant. I would not recommend this class if you are a person who is easily offended or discouraged. The only decent thing is her feedback which goes a bit in depth. However she will call you to read out loud and will scold you for the most basic things.Not the best english, but not so bad that she was impossible to understand. Class material was interesting, but often presented poorly. Be prepared to read your essays in class if she liked a point you made.Not much reading, but all of them are quite informative. He motivated us to read some classic paper in linguistics. However, if you happened to read a bit about linguistics, you should know many of the anecdotes he will share.

Not only is he a great professor whose lectures remind me of reading National Geographic but the course was an easy A. You have to put in effort, but I had by far the best FWS experience among all my friends. If you need an FWS and this is open, TAKE IT!I took Intro with him and he&#39;s absolutely brilliant in his field. lectures were okay (very occasionally had quizzes) and as long as you do the reading the homework and prelims will be easy. Different person teaches Intro to Ling pretty much every semester tho so im sure it variesGives very hard tests and hard assignments as well. TA Hitomi is not helpful at all. Not considerate at all when students are facing difficulties with the pandemic. Stay away from Tilsen!Simply a great professor. I didn&#39;t have the opportunity to speak with him outside class but in lecture he is the embodiment of Santa Claus teaching linguistics. He welcomes questions and takes his time with answers. I&#39;ve heard he offers tea at his office hours. I hope to take plenty more of his classes, and so should you. A really nice guy.Took the class S\/U. Lectures are engaging, but sometimes too technical. Weekly homework. Didn&#39;t even bother buying the textbook. Good as a very broad basic intro to the various subfields of linguistics.Prof. Wayne is very sweet &amp; accessible outside class (although may speak too low in lecture) and he gives cookies in the end of the final exam in May. However, I do NOT recommend taking linguistics if you do not have previous knowledge or are VERY into the subject. It is a pretty hard class for beginners, too dense material and hard graders (TAs).Prof. Hale is a great lecturer (dry, witty, interesting), but he is extremely rude outside of the classroom. Expect to learn only in the classroom and to seek out your help from the TA&#39;s (who are actually not that helpful). I feel like I did learn basic linguistics but it was mainly self-taught and going over the lectures in my own free time.He gives interesting lectures and is very funny, although sometimes he tries a little too hard to get a laugh. He&#39;s awesomely nerdy and passionate about linguistics. Makes a good connection with students and is good at sparking a discussion, even during a lecture. The class is not the easiest, but it is exciting, fun, and well worth the effort.I greatly enjoyed this class. Prof. Despic makes the course fun, engaging, and not difficult. Exams mirrored the weekly problem sets and even had bonus points.THIS IS NOT AN EASY CLASS! If you don&#39;t feel like learning how different tongue positions correspond to different sounds or spending hours graphing sentences, then don&#39;t take this! Hale is cool, he&#39;s funny but he seems to forget it&#39;s an intro class sometimes especially with the vocab he uses. Try flipping through the book before adding this course!Made lecture interesting and was willing to answer questions and explain things. Had really good study guides for prelims.Harsh grader, but justified since the material is covered in class thoroughly. But be prepared to do a lot of test preparation since the questions are specific and tricky.Great class and great professor. It sounds like he was really tough on the psych 1102 class. I guess he must have learned a lesson, because he was great in this class. He&#39;s a very engaging professor, clearly very interested in teaching. I strongly recommend seeing him in office hours, especially if you are interested in the subject.She&#39;s a good speaker, really nice person, and can answer basically any question you come up with. you can generally get by on just paying attention in the lectures.Great class, really interesting. Teacher is very knowledgeable about the material- and very approachableThe course covered all the basic branches within Linguistics, starting with Phonetics, my least favorite, so don&#39;t be put off by that! Prof Harbert is an amazing and sweet professor, he made us cookies after exams. This class is what led me to take Historical Linguistics the subsequent semester. Prof Harbert is the best.Always kept lectures interesting and always willing to help with questions or re-explain things. Exams could be difficult but if you take the class seriously and do the homework you&#39;ll do well, and Prof. Despic does include (fairly easy) extra credit questions on each exam. Great professor &amp; person, really made the class engaging even online.I felt like professor Murray really cared about how we were doing and she was very interesting and knowledgeable.

Lectures are very well organized, clear and concise. He even has a systematic way of erasing the blackboard during lectures. He&#39;s smart and knows the material he&#39;s teaching very well. However, his textbook is really bad. I liked him and his teaching style but frankly, I didn&#39;t really learn much from his textbook.Boring, awful lectures - reading derivations for equations from slides in monotonous voice. Easy exams with extremely high scores leads to minor mistakes having drastic consequences in course performance. TA&#39;s were managed poorly and technology consistently hindered class experience. Cannot reccomend.Great professor - definitely loves the math side of dynamics but also very knowledgeable about the material and fielding questions. Makes you work for the class but at the end of the day is forgiving about grading.I have never been more offended by a professor than with my interactions with Professor Ruina. My recommendation to him is to treat his students with more respect; people are more than their work. You can ask hard questions and challenge students without being rude.Worst Professor ever! He may be smart but his personality and teaching style makes many many students dislike him. I don&#39;t know why there are positive reviews unless they share his affinity for disrespecting other people. Decent professor. Difficult class overall. He is very knowledgeable about Dynamics, though sometimes goes into extreme detail. You will need to work extremely hard for a good grade.Went incredibly fast through lectures at the beginning of the class, calmed down after a few weeks. Homeworks varied, some were easy but others were really long and tough. The material covered at the end was unnecessarily difficult for the course. Was sometimes condescending in lecture but usually helpful at office hours. Open note exams.Ruina knows the subject matter in and out, really encourages asking questions,  engages active strategies to encourage understanding and class participation, and is always trying to improve. However you will work for your grade, and his attitude tends towards tough-love. If you are okay with that, you will enjoy his classes. Class seems to be going well at the start then all of the sudden she throws a bunch of material and assignment at us at a time that we were supposed to be on break. The material that she threw at us was not easy and was not explained at all in lecture, she simply just clicked through the slides without a care in the world for her students.I agree with the review belowHe speeds breathlessly through lectures so it&#39;s hard enough to write anything let alone understand what he&#39;s talking about. Even worse he makes a lot of mistakes in lecture which makes you feel even more lost. Treats dynamics as if we&#39;ve all been studying it for the past ten years. The textbook is just as bad. Plenty of office hrs to help though.","difficulty":3.9090909091,"rating":2.8181818182},{"index":3687,"prof_name":"Matt Miller","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"MAE212","comment":"Very hard class but good teacherhe is a good professor and definitely has a sense of humor.  good class but pretty tough.  hard grader.  lecture only somewhat helpful since mostly straight out of the book, but good at summing up material before an exam.He gives incredibly long and hard homeworks as well as in-class quizzes every week without giving us enough time. Writes notes on the board that are straight out of the textbook. Too many people fall asleep in his class.Most find Professor Miller a bit demanding and intimidating at first, but as the semester goes on you realize that he really cares about his students and just has a different way of doing things...and I can respect that.awesome dude and totally honest..tells you how it is like it should be!This guy is the man.Stubborn! Not willing to accept that not everyone wants what he wants. Class is ok if you can stay awake.If you don&#39;t mind getting &#34;strain hardened&#34;, then go ahead and take his classes.

Tough class.No CommentsHe&#39;s a good teacher, no doubt - he can explain the topics clearly and I did learn a lot - but he pushes the class too hard. Not a good idea to give a project due on the day of the final exam, IMO...I slacked off, didn&#39;t do homework, and basically bombed his class.  He gave me the chance to do a bit of extra credit work at the end to save a passing grade so I could stick with the major.  That gets helpfulness points in my book.No CommentsHis achievements aside, this man is a possible ****, definitely cold hearted, definitely suppressive and absolutely the scummiest of all possible scum bags.You&#39;re either in or out.

He is one of the best professors for general advice that I have ever talked to. I think his goal in 212 is to teach you what it takes to really accomplish something.Bonus points if you&#39;re an athlete.  It is likely that he might give you some leeway in grading if you&#39;re a varsity athlete bordering on failing the class which contradicts his &#34;fair grading&#34; image.Terrible professor. Does not have a command of the material and this shows through his tests and hw problems. You will not learn much if you take his class. You will probably hate him after you take the class ... unless you&#39;re a football player\/dipshit.Stop dwelling on your football years, fool.  I guess I just wasn&#39;t interested in the course material either.  But I REALLY hated the lecture he gave where he classified the types of MechEs... wow.Great prof and person, always entertaining.  However, as a warning, his class (212) is a weed-out class for MAE, so he is a tough grader.  On the other hand, I did learn more in his class than any other engineering class I have takenPeople who don&#39;t like Miller are basically of one type: humorless idiots who can&#39;t face up to the fact they&#39;re not as good as they thought they were. He runs a tight ship and is brutal with the humor, but he actually cares about his students and is as fair as they come. Long live Miller!This guy sucks. He wouldn&#39;t let my friend skip a prelim 2 see a Motley Crue concert in NYC. He&#39;s a giant... whats Cheney&#39;s first name again? Oh yeah, i remember. Dick. Speaking of which he can eat one up. This guy doesn&#39;t keep it real. Peace im out. Anyone got some weed?Consider it done (flaming bag of dog poo).  It should be against some kind of rule to assign a final projecet and have a final due on the same day.

He does a fairly good job during lecture, but what I found most helpful were his office hours. He doesn&#39;t like office hours so he will leave early if you don&#39;t keep asking him ques. He is always around though and encourages students to pop into his office or call him any time. Take advantage of this! He&#39;s hilarious.He&#39;s funny but I have to admit, he is not really a good lecturer.

She doesn&#39;t follow the same methods prescribed in the book. She often makes grammar mistakes in problems which completely changes the meaning of the problem. She often gets in arguments with students over the correctness of her methods.Unsure of syllabus structure, which can be confusing for students. lecture material doesn&#39;t always correspond to prescribed textbook, which makes it doubly difficult to follow the material as there is often confusion between the material in homework and material from textbook.This guy doesn&#39;t know how to talk like he&#39;s a normal person.  It&#39;s like an audio textbook with bad handwriting (and he makes up greek letters i&#39;ve never heard of - or they&#39;re arabic or something).  Some girl actually yelled out in pain during class one time.  avoid him if you can.Horrible lecturer that doesn&#39;t keep a single person awake.  Hard HWs and tests that seem so easy after the fact but are hard to study for and cause a lot of stress when they&#39;re coming up.  Oh, and computer assignments during finals was horrible too.I think Dawson gets too much of a bad rap as a person. Seems like Miller and him drew straws on who teaches 212 vs 325, and Dawson got stuck with the crap end of things. I don&#39;t think that anyone could teach that material in an interesting manner. Go to office hourse, have Hadas explain the projects, work your butt off, get AS&#39;s. Easy.OH MY !!!!  Prepare to be tortured.

Out of 120 students taking the class only about 18 showed up regularly (those who failed the previous year).WORST HANDWRITING IN THE WORLD!!!!!!!!!!!!Terrible lecturing, lessons are &#34;background&#34; to projects (read: &#34;totally unrelated and useless&#34;)... projects are hard and its damn hard to do those A projects... tried talking with him, he just made me more frustrated.  btw Srinivas sucks too.Offensively bad professor.possibly worst professor at cornell.  projects will take you about 40 hours each and then you will still fail them.My god, this guy is the most uncaring professor I&#39;ve ever seen. I literally learned nothing, except a hatred for the material he tried to cover.Dawson is an unusual creature: having put the effort into creating a new type of course in 325, one would expect him to act like he cares a bit more. This is not the case. The man&#39;s a walking sleeping draught, and the work is so tedious it makes me break down in tears.his lectures are complete and utter jiberish.  he uses thousands of subscripts and superscripts and random greek letters that look like scribbles.  which brings me to his handwriting which is completely illegible.  Do the projects, the lectures are worthless.Without a doubt, the worst professor in all of cornell. To make matters worse, he had a TA that never gave consistent grades and it seemed she would randomly assign letter grades. Assignments take forever, and you will do poorly. EnjoyDawson really cares about his students, and if you ask him questions, he&#39;ll be sure to go out of his way to help you understand the concepts.  The assignments and the grading are straightforward.  An optional one week extension of any one deadline makes the class more manageable during crunch times.The projects are very fairly easy if you show up to class and pay attention. Remember to include some key principals  in class in your report and include as much possible in your report.  Most of the time the TA miss stuff on your report and you can get about 1 to 2 points back out of the 15 points if you talk to them.HORRENDOUS.  absolutely miserable guy...you need to goto sections just to get hints on projects, other than that its a good time to goto upson lounge and get a quick nap.  this guy is just a big waste of life as far as teaching is concerned.No CommentsThe projects are enormous pain in the butt. You&#39;re assumed to have known some obscure eqn\/concept that is definitely not stated in the assignment sheet. Therefore, you have to harrass the TA if you want a &#34;guaranteed A&#34; in the course. You have to go to section so that you might get some info to do the project. Just survive this one out.A difficult, miserable, and immensely time consuming course and professor that can single-handedly ruin a semester.  He is impossibly boring and monotonous to listen too, but the worst is his evil curving: He makes even numbers of A?s, B?s and C?s.  Approx: A?s: 90%+, B?s 72-89, C?s: 40-71.  Expect to work 40 hours every two weeks to earn a B.Don&#39;t bother going to class, you can sit in the front row and still not read his handwritting.  Lecture material does not cover anything related to course work and the material that is covered in lecture is done at a superfical level.  Net result: you do busy work and learn nothing for a semester.THE MOST BORING PERSON EVER not to say he&#39;s not a nice guy. The class is all projects. If you do the work, you can definitely pull off an A.I am sitting in his class right now on my friends touch. I am so bored that I want to kill myself. Dawson is so boring that I can&#39;t even sleep. He is droning on and on about some Greek stuff. Do not tale this class if you don&#39;t have to it is miserable . The projects take forever too. Good luck if 325 is required for you.If you have ever fallen asleep in classes, you will in this class. I think this is a class that is a prime example of you reap what you sow. Ask questions, make an effort to be interested, and I promise you, you wont fall asleep. Dawson is a true teacher, he wants to help his students learn. Capitalize on this.Very monotonic and disengaging but cares about his students are is willing to help.  Often times, hes the only person who really understands the materials as the TAs can sometimes be idiots.  The material is quite boring, which compounds Dawsons boring nature.  Information required for the projects if often times tacit and hard to obtain.","difficulty":4.1923076923,"rating":2.0},{"index":3698,"prof_name":"Yingxin Gao","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"MAE3250","comment":"Very difficult to understand.  Doesn&#39;t follow 212 conventions.  Very high pitched voice.  Recommend reading the book instead of listening to lecture.  Doesn&#39;t listen to student voice.Worst professor I&#39;ve had yet here. I&#39;m sure she knows her stuff, but tops even Max Zhang for the Incomprehensible-Chinese-Accent award. Often can&#39;t get across what she wants to, which can lead to wording on tests being vague and confusing when she tries to get clever with a question. Uses iClickers to ensure you basically have to go, too.Really unclear boring lectures. Pointless, overcomplicated projects. Only one prelim that&#39;s worth 30% of the grade, which means if you mess do poorly in the class.Professor Gao certainly isn&#39;t the best professor that I&#39;ve ever had teaching me, but then again, the material for 325 is pretty awful to begin with. Watch out with her board work- r, gamma, and theta look very similar. She improved over the course of the semester, but she needs a few more classes to get comfortable- you could tell she was nervous.Lecture was well organized, printable slides were very helpful. Could have covered some more content. Didn&#39;t dig into fundamentals as much as other courses. She did communicate ways to check numerical results well. Easy homework, though only 5% of grade. Exams were somewhat easy, though needed a little more time. Projects were a good intro to ANSYSProf. Gao is adorable and a really kind person. She is understanding and super helpful in office hours. She really cares about teaching and always asks for feedback on how to be a better professor. She is fair in grading and her tests reflect exactly what has been covered in class and readings.Terrible. Often will give examples in class that she hasn&#39;t worked out on her own or that she will not review the answer. Makes mistakes OFTEN. Admits to not having notes prepared for lecture. Will argue with students when she is wrong. More of a grad student than a professor.

I think he&#39;s a breath of fresh air. People just need to realize that this class isn&#39;t conceptual- it&#39;s more about the final project and labs, that&#39;s where you do the learning.I like going to class, he tries to keep us awake.  Some homeworks problems are tough, most are OK.  First course I have had with no text, on-line notes help a lot.  Robot project is cool, bring things together.Haha what a joke. He is like a guest lecturer. He&#39;s never there. He can&#39;t solve his own problem sets. HAHA.Love his jokes and his office hours are great!Kinda funny, and has decent office hours, but does not really present material well.  You end up having to read the chapters a few times over just to get the material.this man needs to grow up. alcohol-related jokes are overused at this point and not funny.Garcia&#39;s an overgrown fratboy, with his end-of-class keggers and his simplistic ideas about stuff outside the classroom. I find his jokes about the weapons systems he works on and the poor ****s who take it them in the rear particularly tasteless.Poor at explaining things; assumes you know a lot of stuff already; bad handwriting; blocks the board; very lenient when it comes to rules\/restrictions etc.  Garcia is more of a guy you would want to drink with (which u do at the annual 378 party) but not someone u want to get a lecture from. Just a really disorganized class, but not as bad as i thHe clearly doesn&#39;t review over \/ prepare his notes for a majority  of the lectures, as is evidenced by the numerous mistakes he makes. Many people go to lecture just for his antics \/ stories, but the book is the best place to learn if your taking any of his classes, as he doesn&#39;t teach the material clearly and provides more errors than actual help.The person who says he is better now is a fool. He is awful. There is absolutely no way you can say he has prepared us for the homework he has given us. He&#39;s never done any example problem anywhere near the difficulty of the homework and never clearly explained how to solve them, nor given us resources to find out.

Will spend half of class debating what examples to use and whether he should finish them. No one attends lecture so expect many in class quizzes. The help section, however, is well taught and helpful.Easily the worst math teacher I have ever had. I have never had calculus before and did not learn one thing in lecture from him. His style of teaching is dry and he expect so much prior knowledge of students. He also tends to justify points no one cares about and quite frankly just likes to hear himself talk.Bad professor, doesn&#39;t teach. Only went to class to answer Poll Everywhere questions. TA&#39;s are good, make them your friends. Avoid this prof. at all costs, this professor has the potential to ruin your college experience.No resources available to students to learn outside class. Unclear notes and slides.Lectures feel like a waste of time. Most of the course feels like it needs to be self taught and the textbook is basically math taught through critical reading. There are pre-reading quizzes with confusing wording meant to trick you or &#34;test your critical knowledge&#34;. The class also is not curved so you might as well take Math 1110.Litterally the worst professor I&#39;ve ever had. I can teach calculus better than him. I don&#39;t understand how he got a job at this university but it should be completelyreconsidered. I do not know how a man with a PhD in math can confuse himself when he takes a derivative. Thats not something that should happed at Cornell. Someone fire this manForgot to teach derivatives. What calc professor forgets to teach derivatives.Worst class ever. Material itself is really not that difficult but somehow the professor makes it the most confusing thing ever. also a harsh grader. a LOT of homework, quiz, test, prelims, clickers and only 3 credits?! seriously, don&#39;t take this class if you don&#39;t have to.I learned nothing in class. No one participates because it is hard to follow along.  His wording on exams is not straight forwards as he will say we do not need to know something for the exam, however, it is on the exam. The class requires a lot of attention to detail. I learned through  the homework, the book, discussion and the supplementary classAvoid him. Makes the material so much more difficult than it needs to be. He has no idea how to effectively lecture and his wording on exams is extremely convoluted. Again, just avoid him as a professor.This class is the worst ever, the final was literally impossible and absolute hell on earth and I literally got sick of the stress of this.Firstly- we had to write a gigantic paper on calculus.. CALCULUS!!!! The final was the worst thing, homeworks are graded so harshly that NO ONE DOES WELL, and not a thing is clear. I learned nothing from Steve, and if not for my amazing TA, Im 90% sure I would have shaved all my hair off from the stress of this class. NOT WORTH IT!!!! BOOO!!!!!!!He is a nice guy &amp; tries hard to make class interesting. He lectures using a lot of examples but lacks explaining some basic concepts (so section helps). If you have a background in calculus, this class is a breeze. There are a great deal of ppl in the class who have not taken calculus. Weekly problem set are simple &amp; prelims straightforward.Fantastic professor. Hard, but worth it. Curves grade to a B. Definitely knows his stuff, one of the best math teachers I&#39;ve had. Makes lectures interesting and funny. If you put in the work, you will definitely come out of the class with the fundamentals of calculus down.This professor is ridiculous! He talks in the most roundabout ways and is incredibly unclear. If you&#39;ve already taken calc, class is very simple, but don&#39;t expect to learn anything if you haven&#39;t. Not a single person pays attention in lectures and no one would go except he gives a few in class quizzes. Overall, very easy class, horrible professor.He cannot teach at all. You literally have to teach yourself everything in this class. I literally stopped going to lecture because i was more confused leaving lecture than I was when i came in.  TEERRIBLESteve Bennoun is by far the worst professor I have had at Cornell. On top of not being a great professor to begin with (as reflected by rating before mine), Prof. Bennoun was extremely unaccommodating during the spring COVID-19 semester online.

She goes off on random tangents for half an hour at a time and leaves everyone falling asleep. She does try to be helpful if you&#39;re lost, but if you don&#39;t understand it her way, you may never.Prof. Holm is by far the best math professor I had in my life. Her passion for math and teaching makes the lecture interesting and inspires others to transform their attitudes towards math. From her I could totally see myself taking another math class after Calc 1. I&#39;m lucky to have her. Highly recommended.Tara Holm is easily the best math teacher I&#39;ve ever had. Her lectures are rigorous, comprehensive and digestible and by the end I had a really strong grasp of calc 1 and its applications. I was able to coast a little bit having taken AP Calc but even without that it wouldn&#39;t have been overwhelming.Try to avoid taking Calculus 1 with Brock. He is a really nice guy but unfortunately in lectures he just regurgitates the textbook. Lectures are not mandatory but he also does not teach in them. On his exams, the grading is extremely hard, you have to explain every single little detail in order to get full credit (even if your answer is correct).Very confusing... Gets easily flustered when explaining simple things, mixes concepts and often stutters for a good 30 seconds before being able to string a sentence together. Lectures were very confusing. Tests were waaay harder than homework or examples done in class. He taught &#34;recited&#34; from the book. Whenever anyone had a question he would just repeat what he said before. He would get frustrated if somebody didn&#39;t get something. She&#39;s a pretty good prof - does a good job of explaining concepts in class, but can be awkward\/unhelpful at office hours.  She gives you good notes and prepares you well for the prelims and final.This class was miserable. I took Calculus 1 in high school, but was completely lost all semester. We never did practice problems in class (except for note examples). The tests were incredibly difficult and much harder than the assigned homework and class examples. He was completely unhelpful in office hours and was unable to clear up any confusion.She&#39;s was a fairly nice instructor, but quizzes were impossible to finish in the time given and it was difficult to ask her questions because she&#39;d just throw more questions back at you. I think the class as a whole (with its meaninglessly difficult written homeworks, for one) was what made MATH1110 so terrible, more than the instructor herself.Lectures are well-organized. After explaining the concepts, she leaves time for us to practice questions and always walk around to answer any questions with patience. She brings cookies and chocolates to class on Halloween and after prelims. She is really good at making difficult concepts easy to understand and provides general solving strategy.Very nice and eccentric man, but a terrible lecturer. Don&#39;t get on his bad side.Probably one of the most spastic professors I&#39;ve ever had. Since it&#39;s Calc, use the extra study sessions and the math dept. to your advantage to help you do well.He&#39;s really nice and always willing to help. His lectures aren&#39;t really helpful and sometimes it actually makes the material more confusing. He tries very hard though. He doesn&#39;t grade the homework. There are graders that do this and usually homework is annoying and tedious, but it&#39;s manageable.Overall the math classes at Cornell really aren&#39;t the best. This was one of those courses were the professors teaches a minimal amount of stuff in class and then the hw is crazy hard. The tests were ok I guess. The professor was decent I guess I skipped the vast majority of classes but still got a satisfactory.More confused attending lecture than skipping altogetherReally cares about what she does and her students. Makes sure that people understand what is going on in class and explains things very well. A little high strung and a stickler for the rules but over all a great teacher.Absolutely horrible teacher. Do not take Math 1110 with him do it with one of the grad students. If you dont write a page of justification per test problem, you fail. He doesnt teach. He just regurgitates the textbook and plays the essence of calculus videos. He drones on and on and goes so slow. He cares about his students, though.Lectures are fairly pointless as he does not do much other than recite the textbook definitions of various mathematical theorems. If you do not have a good understanding of calculus going into this course you will probably struggle since he does a bad job teaching basic topics.He does not teach, he basically spends lectures reading from the textbook. I learned more from my TA in our weekly discussion. Extremely tedious and harsh grading method. Strongly recommend avoiding this professor.This class made me frustrated with a subject that I loved beforehand. I felt like I was graded on written explanations more than on my ability to find a solution with work provided. I better understood Calc I after this class, but I did not feel that the grading was always consistent with my work.Bottom line, this guy sucks.","difficulty":3.8571428571,"rating":2.6666666667},{"index":3777,"prof_name":"Len Gross","prof_dept":"Mathematics","class_name":"MATH112","comment":"&#34;I&#39;m going to extract a certain oath from you in two minutes&#34; is his favorite expression.

I like that he cares, and he&#39;s ridiculously funny (i think). Good guy!He doesn&#39;t seem to be interested nor to know how to lecture calculus. Nice guy, but the class gets kind of dry sometimesSlightly strange but a very nice guy. I was able to understand him easily and the prelims were pretty straightforward.Very clear and concise. The lecture is not &#34;dry&#34; but precise, something that is essential to mathematics. He is always happy to answer questions, especially if he sees that you are making an effort to understand the problem (which may not always be evident in lecture).Absolutely incompetent. It&#39;s sad the math department has teachers like him- not helpful or clear at all. Hardly interacts with his students even though the classes are fairly small. I had to teach myself all the material for the prelims, but it got to a point where I could not teach myself the topics anymore and the book did not help either.SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EASYHe&#39;s a nice guy, and will try to help you out if you have any questions or problems.  But he can&#39;t teach- nobody seems to understand him.  The good thing is that the textbook covers everything you need to know, but that&#39;s no substitute for a good teacher.interesting personality, but generally a jolly guy. i don&#39;t really learn anything in his lectures though (i learn most of the material at MATH 012) and he gets angry when you ask him questions. you might be better off with a TA for these lectures.He knows what he&#39;s teaching and if you go to him after class to ask him a question, he&#39;ll help.Seems to lecture to himself; but crack a joke, and he&#39;ll be a jolly guy. Be sure to ask him questions, or else he&#39;ll ramble for a while and leave u way behind. He&#39;s obviously more interested in his own work than teaching intro calc; weird fashion sense.Good teacher. He knows what he&#39;s talking about and will make sure you understand it. That said, he tends to teach slowly and also goes off on tangents quite frequently.  Can be funny, but more often a little tiring-perhaps because he goes slowly.  Doesn&#39;t cover all the material but what he does teach, he teaches well.not good.  He does examples straight out of the book, and sometimes makes mistakes when he does them.  while our class only has 20 kids or so, he knows nobody&#39;s name.  You just self teach yourself in this class, which is hard because the book is average at best. Take this course from a different prof- your grade will be helped.Try to have another professor.The worst teacher I have had at Cornell.

One of the nicest and genuinely concerned teachers.By far, this was the most amazing math professor I have ever had. Sit in one lecture and you&#39;ll see why, every definition and example he works through is explained thoroughly and instead of just giving formulas, he derives them so you really understand. I felt prepared for exams because of him. My only complaint is review sheets don&#39;t have answers.He is amazing. He explains math so carefully\/simply that anyone who pays attention will understand everything eventually. This was the only class where I didn&#39;t miss a single lecture because if you do you&#39;ll miss his great explanations. Go to class, do your homework, and do the exam handouts before every exam. And you&#39;ll do greatExtremely unclear, very boring lectures.  Kind of helpful when you ask for it.  Very passionate about the subject material, but you will not be prepared for the tests and will be very bored and confused in class.goodHe is a funny, personable guy. He&#39;s ok as a professor. He spends a lot of time proving things instead of giving concrete examples and applications.  Always willing to help during office hours. For this class, he didn&#39;t give in class quizzes and worksheets like the other instructors did, might have been more helpful. Love his accent and hair though.Great professor. Clear explanations.Great Dame; sweet\/cute, intelligent, and helpful. She sometimes confused me, but at other times, she lit the lightbulb for math. Definitely recommend this class and professor.He&#39;s nice enough, but oh my gosh this man cannot teach! He only ever goes over examples, so you definitely need to teach yourself the material and hope that you get something out of him going over the problem. If you never go to lecture it wouldn&#39;t make a difference in your understanding of the material.Teach yourself or find a different professor!Professor Back is a very friendly man. He, however, cannot teach. Most of what he does in the lectures is simply give examples; and his exams are significantly difficult to boot. The book is helpful, but not always great at explaining things. I can&#39;t say anything about the support course, but I did find his office hours more helpful than all else.Professor Sen is a smart person, but is horrible at explaining concepts. His handwriting is very messy and he often gets lost and confused while lecturing. He doesn&#39;t reference notes while lecturing so there are often many mistakes, but he gets confused when trying to correct them. The tests were extremely difficult.I had to drop the class after the first lecture since I couldn&#39;t understand (1) a word he was saying or (2) what he was writing on the board.  I guess if you already know the material you&#39;ll do fine, but after taking ap calc in hs and getting a 5 on the exam, I still found this over my head.Professor Conelly dresses like a wizard, and is extremely well respected. His lectures were tad boring and were not well organised but, he is good during OH when you come with specific questions. The HW given was tough, but he offered OH 4 times a week. He is extremely caring, especially during the COVID crisis, he made stuff more lenient for usHe&#39;s not a bad guy at all. His lectures are interesting and he can even be funny sometimes. The best thing is that he never assumes you know anything about the subject beforehand; he&#39;s very systematic and methodical. If you&#39;re struggling, he&#39;ll help you out. A great experience for me.Made my life miserable. He may know his subject material, but he cannot teach it well. Office hours are somewhat helpful, but I advise all non-math majors to take this class as S\/U. He is also very absent-minded.Painfully dull lectures and a thick accent.  The tests weren&#39;t horrible, though.He decided to randomly not curve the class at the end and let me know my grade wasn&#39;t based on averages, after giving me a C+. I had always been above the mean and median.Professor Barbasch has a thick accent and expects you to know a lot of difficult material. He speeds through his lectures and it&#39;s very tough to do well in his course. However, he&#39;s there for you if you go to his office hours. He admitted that he has to speed through the course because he has to cover a lot of material. Overall, not bad if you try.Though obviously an expert, Prof. Connelly had incredibly disorganized lectures that were extremely hard to follow. He made frequent mistakes and was often forgetful. The homework and quizzes are very difficult and ask you to go far beyond what&#39;s actually taught. I learned much more from Khan Academy and the textbook than lecture.Sen is not a very good professor. He comes to lectures without a single piece of paper and starts writing stuff down on the board. So the lecture obviously becomes very disorganized. It&#39;s just really, really difficult to follow. I really wish he had some sort of lesson plan. He does try to help when you go to his office.Confusing lectures weren&#39;t related to the material on the exams at all. After the first 20 minutes of the class, he would go off on long tangents doing proofs we didn&#39;t need to know. If you love theory, you&#39;ll do great, but he didn&#39;t teach practical material. Had to learn almost entirely from the textbook and homework.Lectures are extremely disorganized. He spontaneously goes on with his lecture, and everything scatters all directions. Useless. Arrogant too. Also, he forgets to teach things in class and doesn&#39;t seem to care too much. Utter fail.I don&#39;t think he ever turned around to even meet the class. Drones through the material, but respects the kids that go, and will teach helpful tips if you actually go to lecture and listen. Clearly a genius, but very hard to learn from. Mostly learn from support class and repeated book problems.Honestly, he was pretty terrible but I think that&#39;s got to do with him not wanting to teach an intro class. He&#39;s confusing, disorganized and boring. I&#39;d say go to the supplementary class and the review sessions to do well. Attendance isn&#39;t really important but he has like 4 pop quizzes during the semester that count as participation.","difficulty":3.8461538462,"rating":2.8846153846},{"index":3779,"prof_name":"Alexander Vladimirsky","prof_dept":"Mathematics","class_name":"MATH122","comment":"Vladimirsky is difficult, but fair.

Overall decent professor.No CommentsRavi is one of the best professors i&#39;ve had at cornell and he knows his stuff. Even though his classes are tough, he does everything to help his students as much as possible and he&#39;s lecture style is very engaging.He has high expectations, and he likes to make the class as challenging as possible.  Sometimes he knows that most people don&#39;t understand but since no one asks him to slow down, he just keeps going.  It is intimidating to raise your hand in a challenging class like that, but he is really helpful if you do ask your question.Prof. Strichartz is really smart (after all, he is a Putnam Fellow), but his lectures are very unclear and the class examples are just rehashes of the textbook&#39;s examples.  The textbook for the course didn&#39;t help either, it&#39;s a miserable pile of useless equations without explanations.","difficulty":3.4,"rating":3.4},{"index":3780,"prof_name":"Alexander Vladimirsky","prof_dept":"Mathematics","class_name":"MATH1220","comment":"Very difficult but not terrible class. Made the math more complicated than necessary, wouldn&#39;t have learned anything if I didn&#39;t take it in high school, but a great exercise in problem solving and critical thinking. Hard tests but very fair grader. Feels daunting, but not difficult to do well in.Where do I start. This man is the most caring professor you could possibly ever have. Unfortunately, I think he&#39;s only planning on staying for a year, but who knows. Anyways, every class was so funny because of how his personality is and he really thoroughly explains concepts. He cares about his students so if you&#39;re ever lost just email him!One of the best math teachers I&#39;ve had. Very hard even though I have taken calc II before, but learned so much more and prof was very helpful. Exams very difficult.I think I learned more calculus in Prof. Vladimirsky&#39;s class than I did in both Calc 1 in high school *and* Calc 3 at another college. You bet I had to work hard, but lecture was very informative. As an added bonus the Professor introduced the class to the beginning concepts of Analysis.Professor Hatcher is quite the character. I highly recommend taking one of his classes if you would like to see every step worked out and a little (OK, a lot of) humor along the way. The first prelim was really difficult but he gives you credit for what you do right, not docks you for what you do wrong. A great professor.He&#39;s a fantastic lecturer who uses ungraded quizzes and polls as well as worksheets to keep the class engaged. There&#39;s also an enjoyable emphasis on group work. He even posts potential test questions for you and your groupmates to solve prior to taking the tests (one of the questions on that sheet will always appear verbatim).Really nice guy, I loved his lectures. The class is pretty laid back - you still have to put in work and the concepts are very challenging, but he&#39;s not strict with grading and is very understanding.Amazing treatment of theories related to single variable calculus. Completely changed my understanding of Mathematics: there are beautiful interconnections within this subject, not just calculations.Ravi is the single greatest professor ever. Nobody I have had since has ever cared as much about the subject matter or the students. He hosted office hours on Sundays, which was a big time commitment especially during his weekend. He once even went to Goldie&#39;s during lecture to buy us all cookies right before Thanksgiving break.","difficulty":3.6666666667,"rating":4.5555555556},{"index":3781,"prof_name":"Steven Strogatz","prof_dept":"Mathematics","class_name":"MATH1300","comment":"Fun class, lots of games and mini-projects, grading is vague thoughSteve is a living legend.He was a really great professor and really tried to make math engaging.

He may not seem like the approachable type, but he IS willing to help. He writes a tough prelim, very &#34;apply the concept in a new way.&#34; Extra credit for attendance.Read the textbook, it&#39;s more straightforward than lectures.  The only time I thought lecture explained a topic better than the text was random variables.

Never looked up during lectures and mumbled a lot.  Nice person, but lectures were useless.  Only 25% of the class came to the lectures.Great teacher. Makes class interesting and is lots of help if you have questions.he&#39;s hilarious, not a terribly good teacher, but i definitely enjoyed math 171 because of himvery softspoken, but funny in his own way.

He cares a lot about the class, tries to be helpful and always comes to class with a positive attitude. The solutions posted for HW assignments help fill in any gaps missed in class and he posts all of the slides.Nice guy, not very good at teaching and pretty confusing sometimes, but the class is pretty easy if you teach yourself.  You&#39;re allowed to take notes with you into tests.  Not a bad deal.really easy.....i mean honestly it is stats i guess he does an alright job of teaching the material but most of it is just common senseProfessor Nussbaum is terrible. Get very acquainted with the textbook because everything you need to know will be in there. He teaches from the book anyway. No one went to class unless an assignment was due (Wednesdays). Labs are somewhat helpful though so attend those! The prelims and final are around 6-8 questions. Not very hard, but study.Is not the most charismatic prof., but is actually a really nice guy when you talk to him. He is actually pretty good about answering questions and seems to care about the students. Either way, STATS is a ridiculously easy class.Hard to understand in lecture, but the class itself was easy as long as you stayed on top of your work. I stopped going to lecture and found reading the textbook more beneficial, and wound up doing very well... class average was a B- according to transcripts. If you study a normal amount you&#39;ll do very well.Awful Professor. Neither the Professor nor the TA  seem to have a good grasp on the english language which makes it difficult to understand lectures and ask for help. You&#39;re better off taking ILR stats if you&#39;re looking to fulfill a requirement. This was the most painfully dull, challenging classes I have taken.Awful professor and person in general. Not only are his lectures boring, unhelpful, and tedious, he&#39;s also one of the least understanding professors I&#39;ve ever had. On the bright side, the class is super easy, especially if you took stats in high school.He&#39;s a very friendly, approachable professor. He has a moderate accent, but he is definitely understandable. He makes a lot of jokes in class.He is very unbiased and logical. But he is strict, if you would come late to class he would deduct 1% of your grade. So, I rarely went to lecture and essentially taught myself. But lectures are v well organised. HW and labs are easy!! During corona the test was multiplechoice instead of subjective, but he made the rest much easier during the crisisDr. Back teaches statistics with all his heart and you can really tell that he cares about his students. He uses real-world examples which bring the material to life and is always willing to answer questions. He keeps the class engaged, is straightforward when it comes to HW and exams and is a genuinely good man and educator.Please do not take math 1710, professor is awful at teaching. He talks to the board and it is very difficult to understand him. If you haven&#39;t taken stats before you are basically going to have to teach yourself a brand new subject. Prelims and exams are also ridiculous. I found going to the class useless.The professor seems dry and strict at first but if you visit him during office hours he is actually very understanding and helpful. He happily walked me through problems I didn&#39;t understand and gave me partial credit for a prelim question. He&#39;s a nice professor. Class material is harder than I expected. Tests are even harder. Utilize office hoursTake any other classI was extremely hesitant to take math 1710 mostly because of my complete incompetency in statistics. However, this class was absolutely painless, and professor nussbaum is a very fair grader. Because of covid 19, he even pre recorded a separate set of lectures outside of his live lectures.

He&#39;s really nice and helpful and the way he explains the concepts makes them easer to understand than the textbook. Tests can be tricky but if you do put effort to go through all the recitation and workshop materials you should be fine.Prof Ritz is an excellent lecturer - very clear and concise. She moves a bit quickly sometimes, and can seem intimidating, but overall a great professor. The tests for 1910 are very difficult.She likes doing examples on the board,  always pay attention to it. Doing them yourself helps you really learn the material. Also, don&#39;t be scared to ask questions in class, she&#39;ll answer and help you learn. Especially if you sit in the front like me. 1910 isn&#39;t always easy, going to her lectures will help. So please, don&#39;t skip, even if an 8 am!He cares about what he teaches. Tries to make sure that students fully understand how to solve the example problems that he does on the lectures. Tests can be hard sometimes but the curve is always reasonable so it doesn&#39;t (most of the time) hurt the students.Sometimes lectures are difficult to understand, but he seems to want to help.Ng is a good professor, he is clear in lecture, but if you don&#39;t understand the concept fully, when going to office hours he is unclear. Would recommend Professor Ritz instead.His teaching style is different because he is Swedish, and he was educated in a different way. Beware: if he is writing the prelim it WILL KICK YOUR BUTT (average was 64%). He is helpful at office hours though, and willing to help. Don&#39;t let the back sweat intimidate you, he knows his stuff! Likes proofs- which aren&#39;t helpful.He has the stereotypical Asian accent, but he&#39;s understandable.  Textbook is a lot better for learning the material, but he&#39;s willing to go over difficult problems.Ritz is a great math teacher! She is really clear and helpful when explaining topics and is really funny too! Great teacher, and from what I&#39;ve heard, the best professor if you are taking 1910. The prelims are fair (I don&#39;t think she makes them though..) and the content is about what you would expect from an engineering calc class.I would say that Ritz is a great math professor. She is very helpful and open in office hours. However, the class is definitely a challenge... as are many of the first engineering math classes. Tests were written by the other professor, who was definitely a lot worse than Ritz. She also coined the term &#34;Math Happens&#34;!This class is hell.  Not only does he not teach anything relevant, it is completely incomprehensible.  After spending the entire class on a single problem riddled with mistakes, he simply says &#34;well, this isn&#39;t right, but you get the point&#34;.  Avoid this class and this professor all together if possible.  HORRIBLE!!!!!!Literally just the worst.Cool dude. Mixed feelings about the class. Lectures were very good. Homework was unnecessarily hard. TA discussion sections were mediocre and revolved around complicated proofs for the unnecessarily hard homework problems. Prelims and exams fair but decently hard.Good lecturer. Lecture included participation which is unusual and helpful. She would give example problems in class and have you solve them, and give you time to work as she walked around the room to make sure people understood on an individual basis. Was glad to go over things that students didn&#39;t understand.Great lectures, definitely worth getting up before 8am for. Could actually do the hw on my own. Unfortunately, the exams were written by a different professor so that wasn&#39;t too great. Very good at explaining complicated topics in an understandable way and very patient.Overall great guy. Gives good lectures and stays on task the whole time. HW assigned is not too much and tests are not bad either. Never felt like a waste of time going to lecture. However, occasionally he&#39;ll make a minor mistake on the board that is easily fixed. Nothing terrible.Amazing lectures. Explains in full detail. Does not go off topic. Teaches you what you need to know. Great textbook examples in class.Thomas is the man!!! His teaching is all over the place, and his sweat proves to be a major distraction, but professor Johnson is still cool.AMAZING!! Funny, clear, helpful!!! Great class, great professor!He&#39;s an all around great professor. He shows that he actually wants to be teaching even if the class is an intro class. Sometimes his lectures aren&#39;t the easiest, but he is more than willing to explain concepts to you one-on-one if you just ask.He&#39;s a nice guy, and very knowledgeable, but his teaching is not great. The pace of the class is extremely fast, and he expects you to know a lot already. Lectures are hard to follow, dull, and not very helpful for the exam. Be prepared to do a lot of textbook studying for exams. If you need to take 1910, I would recommend a different professor.Often sets up review sessions outside of class, very fair in grading. Decent professor, slightly boring and difficult to understand. Has a good sense of humor.My lowest and worst grade ever at Cornell. For the love of God, I beg you do not take this class. He presents more theory than considered necessary. His ability to be considered a Professor academic makes me look down upon academia as a whole. Impossible exams w\/ bonus points, if you didnt take calc2 in high school, you better start studying nowPoitras is by far the best professor for 1910. He clearly is very passionate about teaching and explains difficult concepts very simply. Many CoE students in lectures with other professors have started watching Poitras instead. He is clear and concise, while still explaining everything fully. He is kind and caring, as well as very engaging.I really struggle with calc but Carl is amazing at explaining things, he&#39;s always in a good mood, he&#39;s always down to help and answer questions. Even the CoE students who aren&#39;t in his class watch his lectures. We changed the GroupMe name to Carl Appreciation GC. If you have to take 1910, take it with him!I would say if you got Calc BC credit in high school to just skip this class. No point in trying to &#34;solidify&#34; your math foundation. I took this class thinking it&#39;d help me ease into college but it was really tough and not worth it. If taking the class I highly recommend using\/reading the textbook.I have no doubt that professor Barbasch is a nice guy, he really tries hard not to let his student fail. But the man can&#39;t teach, lectures aren&#39;t helpful at all so you basically have to self-study everything. Exams are tough. Really my worst experience at Cornell...Healey is amazing. He is smart, funny, composed, and clearly very familiar with all material. He is conveys it well. Not the easiest class, but he is a joy to have lecturing.Healey is simply amazing.  Funny, incredibly smart and actually cares about his students.  Loved every second of lecture.Absolutely amazing! He could explain things in such a way that I understood it immediately. He stayed ahead of the other teachers, but still managed to take time for humor which made me look forward to lecture. The fact that many other students ditched their assigned lecturer to come to Healey&#39;s lectures (people sat in the aisles) says it all.Healey is amazing! Explains things in a very clear and concise way, while constantly entertaining the class with anecdotes about relevant engineering fields.  Always manages to keep lectures engaging by squeezing in some humor without wasting a minute.Carl is a super nice dude, great lecturer and cares about his students. Go to his office hours as much as possible because they are incredibly helpful!! I wouldn&#39;t have passed this course without CarlShe is an amazing teacher! Humorous and also absolutely nice! Her lectures are very organized and clear. Although sometimes the materials are difficult, if you go to lectures and study hard, you will be fine! Prelims are fair (although prelims are not written by her). She gives me a good start in engineering math in college!Professor Healey is a fantastic lecturer, is approachable, and always helpful. His lectures offer helpful proofs- enhancing clarity. He&#39;s hilarious in general and you can tell that he enjoys teaching this course to engineers.Great professor with good lectures. Very clear and easy to understnandHis lectures are clear, crisp, and entertaining. He explains difficult concepts in a way that is easy to understand, and all the while throws in his own hilarious stories about his experiences as an engineer. His tests are challenging but reasonable if you do the homework, study well, and -- like he says -- think it through. Excellent professor.Carl is incredible and hillarious! He makes difficult concepts understandable. Reading the textbook sections after lecture will help make everything click even more. Prelims are challenging but manageable. He cares immensely about each person and his office hours are so helpful. The class is not an easy A but if you work hard, you can do very well.Even english majors would find his class enjoyable.

Definitely recommended. Awesome and very clear lectures. Very approachable and not boring at all!hardest class ive taken. There is hardly any partial credit on prelims and NO continuation points. When i asked why there are no continuation points, the sjamaar simply replied that it didnt exist! this class is more about being careful (when hardly any time is given for exams) than understanding concepts i guess! glad its over.Very enjoyable lectures.

He was very approachable and kind. Loved him.He&#39;s a pretty good teacher and the best thing about his class is the examples he goes through that allows you to understand how to use the concepts he taches.  The one thing that is a drawback is that sometimes he spends too much time on examples and thus isn&#39;t able to cover everything in the textbook sometimes.I came out of lecture knowing less than when I went in.  Thus, I stopped going to lecture, and my grades immediately improved.Ravi is an excellent teacher. The material was challenging, but if you see him after class he will actually help you.\n \n Tests are very difficult but the class is curved.Best Math teacher at Cornell. Very helpful, go to office hours. A wonderfully nice guy. I wish he taught the rest of my classes. Entertaining and very good at explaining things.He is too funny. Once rode a scooter into the lecture room. Always answers questions asked by students in lecture. Easy to understand. Makes his drawings of graphs to the best of his ability with colored chalk.

Hard to understand. Mae sure to read the textbook ahead of time. He was willing to take time outside of class,  but his lectures and examples just weren&#39;t good enough.Gomez was not able to make some of the more difficult concepts clear. His lectures were bland and uninteresting.Gomez is an awesome prof.  He really cares about his students and is always looking for ways to improve.  The course material is tough so going to class is encouraged.  Gomez has great handwriting and draws really good graphs.  Whether or not you go to class definitely read the book.  Tests are extremely fair and partial credit is abundant.Gomez was a pretty ok professor. Was willing to help post-lecture, and clarified aspects of the lecture that caused confusion. Sometimes he would be unclear on certain concepts and I would leave not understanding what happened; reading the textbook is a must. I&#39;d recommend Stillman over Gomez, but Gomez is also a good teacher.Multi is notoriously a hard class; however, Professor Delp has great energy so far this spring. She&#39;s a great lecturer and seems like she really enjoys teaching multi. She has her lectures prepared before hand and does not get side tracked. I really like her so far.Multi was hard for me. I had morning classes. It was bad. However, Stillman&#39;s lectures are not only fairly organized and clear, he made calculus entertaining. He&#39;s incredibly friendly and approachable and always willing to offer help.   1920 might have been a hard math class, but Stillman made it bearable. I highly recommend.Her lectures don&#39;t make any sense and don&#39;t help with homework or section. Alot of notes aren&#39;t given and the group work is stupid.Kelly&#39;s lectures are energetic and she&#39;s enthusiastic about sharing her love for math. She also tries her best to provide visuals for a better understanding of the material. However, it is multivariable calc, and won&#39;t be easy.She is very energetic during lectures and is open to answering questions. Uses a lot of visual representations, which helps with understanding the 3D structures in multi.She ditzes out - a lot. And her voice is annoying. And goes on tangents about graphs, and the &#34;+, -, 0&#34; game. For Example - she didn&#39;t know the name of the fingers. and then spent a couple minutes telling us about it.She&#39;s really sweet and nice but the problem is she can be a little scatter-brained and she makes a lot of mistakes. She&#39;s very good about catching and correcting them but by that point you&#39;re already confused. Multi is hard enough even with good lectures.Delp is a really cool person who is obviously very passionate about math. Lectures are sometimes tangential and the tests are way too hard (especially prelim 1)Gives sample past exams but doesnt give solutions. What&#39;s wrong with her brain?Dr. Delp is a passionate, energetic, and dynamic lecturer who made me love multivariable calculus. If you have to take 1920, take it with her--the class and her exams are FAR more fair than other professors who teach the class. Lectures are essential for understanding conceptual parts of the course, which she loves to test on her prelims and final.Great Professor. Unlike many professors here she cared about us learning the material and having fun along the way. Dynamic lecturer, and she really goes deep into the visualization of the nitty gritty concepts, which was a lifesaver for a visual learner like myself.Professor Delp&#39;s office hours were extremely helpful. Don&#39;t be afraid to schedule an appointment with her as wellshe&#39;ll go above and beyond to make sure you understand a difficult topic.Kelly Delp is an amazing lecturer! I was intimidated by multivariable calculus but she made it quite easy to understand. It is the best class i have taken so far.What a wonderful guy in general! I heard many horror stories from Multivariable calc, but he made this class a breeze. It wasn&#39;t easy, but if one works hard, he can succeed greatly with Stillman. The textbook Thomas&#39; calculus is very helpful.Stillman is an excellent professor. He knows the subject very well and is very articulate in lecture with helpful examples. I highly recommend him.Very clear and enthusiastic during lectures. Never really went to office hours or interacted with him much though.An absolutely amazing professor! I was worried about transitioning to higher level mathematics, but he made the material fun and easy to understand. I cannot recommend him enough.Stillman is a great professor! He always has energy and a funny story to tell. His examples are helpful also.Excellent Professor. The concepts, especially toward the second half of the class, are difficult to grasp but Stillman was enthusiastic and creative in his approach of teaching the material - making it easier to comprehend. It&#39;s also amusing how he always uses the same character, Little Johnny, in his crazy examples.Take him. Do whatever you can to do so!!!Stillman is probably one of the best math professors you can have at Cornell.  His lectures are very clear, homework is completely doable, and office hours are super useful. He is a fantastic guy and his constant &#34;Little Johnny&#34; examples are a great way to make sure you&#39;re paying  attention. Take him at all costs! You won&#39;t regret it!Stillman is an excellent professor and a great guy.He explains topics clearly, lets us ask questions and makes the class engaging (gives examples about Little Johnny). He is very helpful in office hours. You have to take this class! Probably the best math class you will take!I took this class about a year ago, and it still has been my favorite class at Cornell. One reason is definitely Stillman taught this course. He explained everything so clearly especially when he used models in physics to give the abstract math terms lots of intuition thoughts. He is also a most accessible prof. He replies emails very politely alsoProbably the best professor I had this semester.Best Professor this past semester, and probably one of the best at Cornell. Explained topics clearly, kept lectures engaging with his enthusiasm, jokes, and Little Johnny problems. Definitely take this class with Stillman!Great professor, really enjoyed his lectures. Professor Stillman had terrific in class examples that very well explained concepts and was helpful in office hours as well. Textbook examples reinforced what I learned in class, but his lectures really helped me understand the concepts.Read the txtbk before you come to class. If you ask him how he got a number to try out, he will say &#34;by intuition&#34;. I learned straight from the txtbk but his examples in class and test questions were much harder. He is nice and funny though! He&#39;s just really bad at explaining stuff. Study well and study hard or just be born knowing the stuffStillman&#39;s lectures were generally well organized and engaging. He is very funny and approachable in and out of class. Some homework and exam problems, however, were extremely challenging and a level beyond the material covered in class.Lectures are very clear and well organized. The material is difficult but he does a very good job of stepping through each concept. Prelims are fair and you&#39;ll be fine as long as you&#39;re comfortable with the homework. Professor Stillman&#39;s lectures are clear, organized, and often entertaining. There are problem sets due every week, though they are never arduous, and he has regular office hours for those who need help. Overall, a great course taught by a great professor.Stillman was a good lecturer although I didn&#39;t really find his lectures useful for some of the topics. Overall a really nice guy and very enthusiastic.Great professor, lectures are very clear and funny.Great professor, interesting lectures. One of the best classes I&#39;ve taken at Cornell.He&#39;s sort of dry at times, but he is definitely a great teacher. He has an occasional joke which is always funny. He is a good teacher and really cares about his students and will help if you just ask. Definitely recommend him.This guy&#39;s great.  Had him for both 1920 and 2940.  I&#39;ve never seen someone have so much fun talking about math.His lectures are littered with mistakes, and I genuinely think I learned less by going to them. I stopped going to them half way through the semester and my results were the same. Luckily, MATH1920 is a really easy class now since they got rid of prelims.He tries... but that&#39;s not saying much. He will teach material incorrectly, and he constantly asks students if he made a mistake.Literally and figuratively the worst math teacher I have ever had.He seems nice, but his lectures are riddled with enough mistakes to make even the most patient students want to bash their skulls against their desks.  He&#39;s very theoretical.  Also, he has a helix fetish.His lectures are very unclear. He does not pick very good examples. He is not very good at answering questions.  My TA was terrible.  Way too theoretical.  Odds are, your book will become your professor.  There are 2 other profs for this class, I would recommend that you try them all the first week of class to see who is the best  for you.Connelly is not very good at explaining anything.  Lectures lack any sense of flow, he chooses bad examples, and he is bad at helping people understand if they have questions.  Do not save homework for the last minutes, it always takes a while.  There are two other profs that teach the course, try them instead.Great guy. Had a kid in class. His wife, not himLectures were useless. Just went over theorems and a couple examples. Did not help from the problem solving aspect, which I felt was most needed. Prelims were very difficult, especially the final. I wish detailed answers were given for the homework. And forget about being able to sit up close if you don&#39;t get there 20 minutes before class!Very good choice of a professor. Lectures can be a bit difficult if you don&#39;t sit near the front as he has a bit of an accent and a mumble - but he will throw in a little joke every once in a while. He is also willing to stop and answer questions during the lecture. Although tests were hard, it wasn&#39;t unreasonable given what was covered in lecture.Pretty solid lecturer; his teaching is a bit dry, but he throws in the occasional joke to lighten the mood. He definitely knows his stuff, and doesn&#39;t mind taking the time to answer questions or explain in further detail. The 1920 exams are absolutely wicked, but he does a decent job preparing for them.His lectures are pretty useful overall, having a good mix between theory and examples. Math 1920 is a hard class overall, but he does a good job of making sure we have a grasp on the material. He really seems to look out for his students, and he&#39;s always willing to stop lectures to answer questions.Beyond being a great lecturer and being passionate about what he teaches, Prof Strogatz really cares about his students. Even though our classes were online, he tried to interact with us as much as possible and would always stop to explain if a student was lost. You could really tell that his goal was not only to teach but also to inspire us.Great lecturer. Yes, he follows the textbook, but he doesn&#39;t regurgitate it - he makes the information more clear and presents examples that aren&#39;t in the book. I particularly appreciated that he organized the board in a methodical, easy to follow fashion as he went. Not all math professors are good at this.Connelly is a good guy, but an awful teacher. Makes many mistakes during lecture, often disorganized and unclear, rambles on topics completely irrelevent to course, and often pauses during lecture to try to fix his mistakes. His lectures are usually near-empty as everyone realizes its uselessHis lecture was totally useless.  He generally spent half of each lecture attempting one example several times, letting students correct him all the way through.Connelly is such a nice guy, but not a good teacher, especially for engineering math. He is very theoretical, spends way too much time proving things, and is very unclear. He&#39;d probably be a fantastic theoretical math prof, but he&#39;s a terrible engineering math profsingle handedly ruined calculus for me. he&#39;s a nice man and he means well, but he&#39;s crazy. says the strangest things in class and hes very confusing. useless going to his lecture.Connelly is a great guy, but I would not recommend taking his lecture. I&#39;m currently in his 9:05 lecture, and I just sleep-in because I feel the extra hour of sleep will benefit me more than going to his class. Enroll in Matsumura&#39;s lecture.He&#39;s OK - he is highly theoretical although the class is intended for engineers. He also makes frequent mistakes during lecture, and isn&#39;t really that clear. He&#39;s acceptable, but definitely try to get a better lecturer for 1920 if possible.If you know math VERY well and you just want to hear derivations of formulas and be challenged with complicated questions, this is the teacher for you. If you actually want to learn, especially if your learning from scratch, like me, find someone else.Really nice and funny guy. Some of the tests are excruciatingly hard though. 1920 is known to be an engineering weed-out class. His lectures are kind-of all over the placeFine lecturer (nothing outstandingly good or bad), granted I stopped going about mid-way. Sort of funny, accessible other than that you probably have class during his OH. I find that if you&#39;re diligent about reading the textbook and taking notes on your own in advance, the lectures don&#39;t add much. Exams are harder than the homework problem sets.I had him for multivariable calc and he was a great teacher. He was out of his subject matter and he did an excellent job of teaching the material. He was clear, comprehensive, and loved to interact with the class.He was a solid lecturer. His lectures started with the theory and he then worked through good examples. I liked to look over the chapter summaries from the textbook before lecture (those chapter summaries were amazing). And quick note: he typically finishes class 1-5 mins late.Very nice person. He is very passionate about math and would often include funny side comments\/jokes every so often to lighten the mood. Very knowledgable. The exams were very tough, but that&#39;s not entirely his fault, the course is hard as is whether its Sjamaar teaching or anyone else.Prof. Yang, or Dennis, as he goes by, was a strong teacher.  His notes largely followed the book, but he seemed much more interested in us learning the concepts and theory behind the math than how to do the specific examples.  I only went to his office hours once, but he spent a long time with me making sure I understood a problem very thoroughly.I found the shear quantity of mistakes Connelly would make while teaching completely unacceptable. A professor should never have to ask his students if everything he put on the board is correct. By the end of the semester, most of my class was attending other lectures because Connelly&#39;s was completely useless.As others have said, Connelly is a boring lecturer. His examples were all theoretical and not what we would see on homework nor tests. He basically teaches right out of the textbook. He did seem to improve throughout the semester, however, which is good, because it implies that he does listen to student feedback, but by then, it was too late.Connelly is a nice guy, but not the best teacher. I started going to the other professor&#39;s lectures after the first few weeks. The hardest part of 1920 is the volume of material they expect you to learn, so make sure you stay caught up and its much more manageable. Multi is actually pretty cool but unfortunately they don&#39;t present it the best way. Clear lectures that really take care to walk through explanations and give examples. Tough exams, but the lecture, homework, and discussions try to prepare students for them, so they are always doable.One of my favorite professor! He is so helpful with my class, and I was so impressed by his way of solving problems. Other students and I always ask him problems right after the class, and he always stays 20 minutes or 30 minutes later to answer our problems. His homework is tough, but his tests is not hard at all.The class is super hard, and requires a lot of work, but Prof. Marshall&#39;s lectures are very clear. He&#39;s also pretty funny. I just wish they hadn&#39;t been 8am lectures, because if you miss class, the course will get much harder than it needs to be and work will most definitely pile up.A decent teacher, and a good sense of humor. Don;t miss any classes though, you&#39;ll spend weeks trying to catch up.I love this guy - he is very friendly and has a dry \/ decent sense of humor. Very approachable and very very enthusiastic and clear lecturer. Definitely would recommend.Excellent lecturer - very clear and helpful. Also very nice person and definitely approachable. By far the best prof. for Math 1920Awesome teacher and person. One of the best math teachers at Cornell. Definitely would recommend.Awesome professor.Personally, his lectures were ok. They were extremely middle of the road. However, his review lectures were exceedingly helpful towards getting a good score on each prelim. Overall, I think my grade mainly reflected my own reading of the textbook rather than the quality of his lectures and his teaching style.The best math professor at Cornell, period. He posts his lectures on videonote, which is nice. If you have a chance to take a class with him, DO IT! He makes sure you understand everything perfectly.If you came in knowing the material ahead of time or read the section before the lectures, his lectures were very helpful. Professor Jenkins was also very funny, which helped lighten the mood when the lecture material got dense. He was also very encouraging of people to get help during his office hours if they did not understand something.Some might find his lectures a bit dry, but he is such a wonderful professor. Explains things super clear and is always happy to answer all sorts of questions from students. I attended both his and another professor&#39;s class for math 1920, and Sjamaar definitely has it more organized. 10\/10 recommend him.The best lecturer out of the 3 Math 1920 profs. His lectures actually made sense and at the end of the semester, I felt like I had learned something. His examples sometimes helped with homework problems, which was great. I honestly wish I had gone to more of his office hours because he seems like such a nice, wonderful old dude.Great lecturer (a lot clearer than Connelly). He mostly just lectures out of the textbook, though (even the examples are the same)Great professor. Lectures were long, but easy to understand and incredibly helpful. Always willing to answer questions and make sure the class understood the material. I did not have him at first, but after having him, I could understand materials more clearly. One tip is please go to office hour when you don&#39;t understand something. DO NOT PROCRASTINATE. Jenkins responds your questions in detail, so ask a question. If you are afraid of asking questions in class, use him after lecture or office hour.Connelly frequently made mistakes on the board while lecturing.  He is not a clear lecturer.  Class would have been significantly easier if I knew what was going on.Have to use the textbook to learn the material well.To be fair I came into this class with prior experience in multivar. He does a great job conveying the eloquence behind the theorems being taught but he&#39;s not the best at teaching basics, which is tough if this is your first exposure to the material. Beyond 1920, hes incredibly accomplished (check wikipedia) and wears great outfits so thats cool.Great professor. Gives clear lectures, and is ready to help even in a class of 250+ students.Good class, but you have to study pretty well to do well (I slacked off before the first prelim and highly regret it haha). Lots of available resources provided by the prof, just have to make use of them. Additionally, really reached out to help students especially during this weird covid era.Makes several mistakes and is known as &#34;Goth Moses&#34; by among the students. Lectures are essentially useless... READ THE BOOKMATH 1920 is viewed as the weed-out course at Cornell. However, with professor Jenkins, I was not only able to understand the bare minimum of the material, but I was able to gain a well rounded understanding of multivariable that the other professors were not able to deliver. He is always willing to answer questions, and is just a nice guy!Prof. Jenkins focuses primarily on the mathematics and formulas, which I personally preferred for Multi; however, his lectures are very dry and monotonous at times. Considering how difficult the class content is, he is definitely an amazingly clear professor. I&#39;d really recommend using his office hours if you need help understanding the content. Great person, I like him a lot. However, his lectures are so scattered and he teaches nothing relative to his quizzes\/tests at all. I stopped going to lectures all together and just relied on the textbook. He makes lots of mistakes in lecture; he&#39;s funny and cares, though. If you have no prior experience with material: steer clear.Jenkins is a great professor. His lectures are clear and exams &amp; problem sets are manageable and worth your time. Would take any class again with him!His speaks the way a math book is written. His energy level is quite low. The homework and quizzes are easy, but the exams are unnecessarily hard. He&#39;s an excellent mathematician, not a great lecturer.","difficulty":3.3958333333,"rating":3.5520833333},{"index":3792,"prof_name":"Siu-Hung (Richard) Ng","prof_dept":"Mathematics","class_name":"MATH2099","comment":"Made an already difficult class even more uneccesarily difficult during covid.

Yes, you will have to read the book. Best thing is to go to his office hours, he does the homework for yoBerest is a very clear lecturer, and he uses the board very well. His accent can get in the way, but overall he relays the information well. And he tries to make jokes, which work about 30% of the time. At least he tries. But an enjoyable class overall.Nice guy, but not the most effective teacher.  He seems to confuse a somewhat easily understood topic.nice man but can&#39;t teach for crap, speaks Bulgarian with English accent, speaks too fast, can&#39;t write, homeworks and exams are way too difficult, the curve is unfair, homeworks are harshly graded.DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  HEAVY accent, tests too difficult, unwilling to help because it will give away answers.  Sloppy on board.  TA&#39;s unhelpful.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Take a different course, this one is basically useless.I hated his class, I hated the way he taught, I hated everything about Math 213. But then I went to Office Hours during Study Week and even though I failed three out of the four tests (including the Final), I still pulled off a C. So I can&#39;t give him a really bad rating.He&#39;s a nice guy, and he tries, but the lectures are very disorganized and hard to follow.  The book isn&#39;t much better.  Thankfully the TA was pretty good and managed to explain more of the things that the prof. couldn&#39;t.

Great guy, eager to help, smiles and makes a few jokes, all around a good guy, if not a little hard to follow.  And he does use a scooter. and a bike.He&#39;s a decent teacher, gets off track a bit, but that&#39;s okay. There&#39;s not too much homework, just weekly problem sets that never end. Watch out for those prelims! They like em really difficult.Extremely boring professor. Does not have a clear lecture plan, you end up doing most of your learning from the textbook. Going to class does not help in your understanding whatsoever. NOT RECOMMENDED.Rather an odd fellow...stares at the ceiling a lot.  But he&#39;s a good lecturer, and obviously an intelligent man.He&#39;s a brilliant man, I wish I could understand all he tried to teach us. I think that was the biggest problem - teaching on a level that most undergraduate students could understand. Fascinating and intelligent.The class is ridiculously easy in that you hardly have to do anything to do well on the tests. Even so, his lectures are useless and I could not understand a single thing he tried to explain. It doesn&#39;t help that it is also impossible to read his handwriting on the board.Lectures were absolutely useless the entire semester.  Learned jack.  Doesn&#39;t seem to work his own problems for exams so doesn&#39;t know exactly how doable (or not) his own exam is.Bright guy, but just can&#39;t speak english or teach math. He doesn&#39;t understand your questions, and his lectures have no structure or logic.Very unclear, skips steps in proofs, hard to follow, in general difficult to understand.This is a very hard class, and Zaffran didn&#39;t make it any easier. I think he&#39;s a very nice guy, but it&#39;s hard to understand what he&#39;s saying with his accent and he doesn&#39;t make the material very understandable in lectures.Overall a nice, amusing guy, a decent lecturer, and helpful if you ask.  The class wasn&#39;t that bad, especially after the first few weeks.Best math teacher I&#39;ve ever had.  Makes linear algebra really interesting, nicest guy ever.  His lectures are really clear and thorough, almost word for word from the text book.  The french accent is cool too.The most kind and compassionate professor on this campus!  You will all do well in his class because he doesnt care about grades as much as he cares about teaching you how to logic, reason, and think.Professor Hatcher is a darling. He comes to class on his scooter, uses what looks like a kids&#39; backpack, and has crazy hair. He&#39;s endearing in that absent-minded professor way; his clarity and helpfulness are compromised only by his tendency to get off-track.The class was pretty easy but I still felt like I learned something.Easy assignments, useless lectureshe is so awesome!  Makes linear algebra really fun and understandable.  His teaching style is cool and makes class very interesting.  Very helpful in office hours, and a really nice guy.  The tests in this class should be fine if you study.Ravi is absolutely amazing! He makes a really hard class fun and interesting, and he really knows his material. He works hard to find concrete examples that make sense, and he is SO amazing in office hours! He really wants his students to learn and do well!Very smart professor and knows his material well.

I wish all my classes are taught for him!Amazing lectures. Office hours were super helpful! Patient, funny, great at explaining concepts and solving problems. He would add extra office hours before exams, which was very, very nice.The lectures were fine for the most part.  The material wasn&#39;t that bad but the tests were tricky and not straightforward.Greatest professor ever! His tests are just like the sample tests. The first quintile on a prelim was 118...out of 120. Take any of his classes.He&#39;s nice in grading and test. Useless lectures.No textbook for course. No need to attend lectures. Homework is hard but workable. Extremely easy exams.He has decided to no longer use a textbook so he has his long printed lectures that he just reads in class so there is no point in going to lecture.  Homework is difficult and for me, going to TAs office hours were a must- his were useless.  He is a nice grader though.  I got a 33% on the first exam and I still got an A in the course.Nerode is an amazing mathematician but it&#39;s just very hard to understand him because he lectures on such a high level.  He is getting older and he can be very impatient and incompetent at times.  The class was hell, the assignments were very tedious and people at the support center even said he is odd, to say the least.Took linear algebra with Prof. Nerode in Spring 2013. Professor Nerode is a very kindhearted and caring man. He&#39;s a great person, but unfortunately not mumbles to himself in lecture, but that&#39;s totally understandable since he is 81. Problem sets were mostly all proof-based (great for math majors) while prelims only had computation-based questions.Prof Nerode is an excellent person, and always ready to help. His lectures can be slightly unclear at times but if you study the material, its almost fine and the Prof is always there to spend time with you to help you understand. Willing to help out beyond his class. Homeworks are sometimes long and hard, but fairly graded and exams are quite easyHe is a legend in the Math world, but he is old and lacks clarity during his lectures. However, discussion sections are helpful, and as long as you hand in all of your homework assignments, you should do well. Also, there were two in-class exams and no prelims nor finals. Get to know him though; he is a very interesting man.Good professor. He explains things in a clear and intuitive way, and also is just a fun guy. He juggles, and he showed our class some of the math behind juggling toward the end of the semester. The last few lectures didn&#39;t cover material in the book, but it wasn&#39;t on the exam either, so it was OK.Professor Nerode is a fine mathematician, and a very interesting person to listen to, but I unfortunately learned next to nothing in his class. He gave us an overview of the subject matter more than an explanation of it. The main ideas seemed to be there, but we never got any real practice in order to assimilate them.Easiest class ever! Shankar Sen really knows how to teach! A hot professor!He&#39;s stern on attendance and assigns regular homeworks. The weekly quizzes follow directly from the homework. His exams tend to be on the hard side, but they&#39;re all fair. The practice exams, especially for the final, don&#39;t match the actual exam. His biggest weakness is too few examples IMO. He has a dated sense of humor that&#39;s consistently amusing.Healey is hilarious. Tough course though but he tries to make it fun. Try to follow him up in the lecture.   he covers a lot Professor Halpern-Leistner was excellent! He would not only answer your specific questions about the materials, but also quickly identify your conceptual problems and give clear, succinct explanations. Very knowledgeable and understanding. Would definitely take again!Daniel was teaching tough material to a fairly unreceptive crowd (of 15-20 at most since attendance wasn&#39;t required), so lectures were informative but pretty dull. Oftentimes he would get sidetracked in explaining things way beyond what we needed to know for the class and hard exams. However, he really enjoys the material and will answer questions.The class I took (Linear Algebra) is difficult, but I think Halpern-Liestner reviews and clarifies things well. Going to lectures helped me quite a bit.No CommentsGreat Professor. I even nominated him as we evaluated the faculty at the end of last semester. Crystal clear; the note on blackboard is extremely good and informative. If you want a solid grasp on linear algebra, I recommend taking his class and don&#39;t miss a single class!Material and prelims were tough, but his lectures definitely made everything a lot clearer than what it could&#39;ve been. Very responsible, answers questions quickly on Piazza, and holds extra office hours and all. Amazing professor.mediocre lecturer. just regurgitates the textbook, moves really quickly. grading only depends on the tests, which really depends on which semester u take it. homework takes a while and our prelims were ridiculously hard.Came back to rate him after 3 years. Best maths prof I ever had - halfway into the semester I literally gave up my original lecture session and skipped lunch to attend his. He lectures and writes on the board clearly. Also gives interesting examples every once in a while. Students are encouraged to ask and answer questions during lecture.Professor Peeva was definitely a clear professor who taught the concepts of Linear Algebra in an understandable way. However, the course structure made it extremely stressful. They recently changed the curriculum and we had no idea what to expect. The TA&#39;s were awful and made the class so much worse. One of the hardest class I have ever taken.Don&#39;t take his class if you want to learn the material. Literally didn&#39;t learn anything. Got an A in the class. What he teaches and what&#39;s on the tests are completely different.Weird seeing how great he is for upper level courses. Not organized, occasionally goes in circles, and usually 2-3 lectures behind the other professor. I ended up teaching myself material from the textbook, but you should still attend lectures because they can be helpful.Jim West is very kind and intelligent, but I fear that since he was been an expert in &#34;Geometric topology and infinite-dimensional topology&#34; for so long, he no longer really is able to teach undergraduate classes. That means he usually is unable to explain the material in a way that someone new to the material can really understand it.He certainly is clear about lecture materials, but poor in delivering those to students. Besides, he takes attendance this semester when a lot of students didn&#39;t show up on class...If there is definition for an average class, this class is it.  Everything is predictable; do the homework, go to lecture, put in some work for the class and you get an A.  He&#39;s not the most exciting professor however and will talk quietly while he basically reads the textbook to you.  But the class is not overly difficult.uhhh.....just ok, his lecture is not very helpful. I only copied what he wrote on the blackboard. If you don&#39;t look back and review, you will forget everything he said.Horrible. absolutely horrible. Math was my favorite subject coming in and now I hate it because of this guy. If you end up with him because of your schedule, SWITCH OUT. It&#39;s not worth it. Change your entire schedule to escape this guy. You won&#39;t regret it. He&#39;s just terrible.Started off with him for the first 5 weeks of the semester but did horribly on my first prelim cuz I didn&#39;t learn anything from him. Wu just mumbles as he copies his notes onto the blackboard in lecture. His CV says it&#39;s his first time teaching linear algebra and second time teaching overall so he doesn&#39;t seem to know what he&#39;s doing. Best avoided.This dude is so diorganized, please take the alternate teacher for whoever is teaching linear algebra. Doesnt speak up very well, adn terrible handwriting on the board.

No website and unclear grading guidelines. Not great not horrible.This was Hubbard&#39;s first time teaching the non-honors sequence and he made it WAYYYY more complicated than it&#39;s supposed to be by introducing concepts from the honors sequence like the implicit function theorem, the exterior derivative, and differential forms.

Very smart, excellent lecturer and presenter, and highly receptive to student feedback during the course. HW is usually difficult, but that should be expected.He always looks down on students when they ask him questions and doesn&#39;t help prepare students for the prelims.  His curves aren&#39;t that fair and doesn&#39;t give a fair amount of partial credit.Tests did not represent material from lecture or textbook at all. He gets mad at students for asking questions and his grading policies are ridiculous.He is not a great lecturer, and often veers of topic. His lectures do not correspond  to the homework and the prelims. I would not recommend taking this classAlthough not always clear, he was always ready to explain further. Indeed, he seemed disappointed when the class didn&#39;t ask as many questions as he anticipated.No one seems to understand what he is lecturing about and I found his discussion of Klein bottles to be unrelated to the material.  It confused me more and he looks ridiculous.  Don&#39;t take his classLectures are quite uselessHatcher was a great lecturer, but prelims were on the difficult side and problem sets were rather time consuming.1. incomprehensible handwriting 2. bad pronunciation 3. not good voice 4. exam questions exceedingly difficult 5. low textbook usage. I dont think he is a bad person but he is the worst as a teacher.Great professor, a much better choice than the other instructor who taught another session this semester. Professor Yang explains ideas behind multivariable calculus well enough for us to understand. Any questions? He is always helpful during office hours!Tough to understandHonestly the worst teacher I&#39;ve ever had. While I don&#39;t doubt he is a fine person and a really smart guy, his lectures are insufferable and I absolutely despise this class. The only time class should ever be attended is if there is a homework quiz. If you can learn form the book, the class is fine, but otherwise you&#39;re kind of screwed.Problem sets were often needlessly difficult. He also has a habit of lecturing on things he likes that are kind of related to multi but not tested on the final. He definitely knows the material and can explain how to do problems well, but that&#39;s when he chooses to stay on topic. My recommendation is to just do problems from the book and ignore psetDifficult course. A lot of blackboard notetaking, but helpful.His lectures are interesting and very well-planned. He is very open to feedback and is always available and very receptive to questions. He clearly cares a lot about his students and how they do. Difficult class but if you go to lecture and office hours you can absolutely succeed.Brilliant lecturer; lessons were enjoyable and easy to learn from. Very interested in ensuring students were doing well. Examples and applications from physics and the social sciences were used. Prelims were very easy but the final was a little trickier. Strongly recommended.Great lecturer with a subtle sense of humor.  The class is incredibly easy but don&#39;t be fooled!  The curve can work against you.Terrible lecturer.  He&#39;s obviously a brilliant mathematician, but he cannot for the life of him explain even simple concepts. Lectures are completely disorganized, and he makes tons of mistakes in examples. He probably makes sense to people to whom math comes intuitively, but for 90% of the class this isn&#39;t the case. Exams were ridiculously hardReally just a terrible professor. The only thing that saved this course was that another teacher for the course and the TAs in the course were trying to make the tests at least somewhat reasonable and allow students to pass. Were it not for the help of my TA&#39;s, I would have failed this course and learned nothing because Connelly is that bad.Townsend is a really passionate and good lecturer. He prepares you for the exams really well. The textbook was frustrating and the distribution of quizzes (given during discussion) was not organized well, but you can tell Townsend tried his best and really cared about the students.","difficulty":3.6666666667,"rating":3.0416666667},{"index":3799,"prof_name":"John Hubbard","prof_dept":"Mathematics","class_name":"MATH223","comment":"Appalling handwriting.Professor Hubbard was kind and amusing, but he seemed arrogant, and his lectures are difficult to follow.  His textbook is quite helpful though; he&#39;s strength is in writing.  I think his general character\/accent make the lectures harder to follow, but the textbook and TA will definitely help.No CommentsWonderful professor. He is so bright as a mathematician and as a person. For those of you who are math oriented, he is the guy who NAMED the Mandelbrot set. Warning: Extremely difficult class. I remember writing up more than 10 pages for a single problem. But if you truly love math, go ahead and takHard class, but Hubbard is a good teacher. If you ask questions he will take the time to explain.Very good professer!  Really knows her materials, though the class moves really fast.  She is extremely willing to help you at any point to make sure no one is confused.Strichartz&#39;s lectures are incomprehensible and his command of the material, as evidenced by his joke of an analysis text, is seriously questionable.Hubbard is a great guy and you&#39;ll really enjoy this class if you are willing to work hard. At times his lectures were a bit confusing and his methods were not exactly straight forward, but they were mostly a lot of fun so he is definitly worth taking a class from.just a reminder to anybody looking at this page that the math department professors rate themselves to raise their scores. Strichartz is a failure as a professor and will literally not write notes on the board. Also has bordeline pedophilic tendencies and you should avoid him if possible.Prof. Strichartz is a great lecturer, and just a jolly guy.  He&#39;s very approachable and quite funny.He embodies everything that makes people think that math is a difficult, undecipherable subject.  There were 40-50 students in the beginning but came down to 17.

Very cool and interesting class.Outstanding professor: clear, entertaining lectures (sometime with juggling), useful problem sets, fair tests, quirky humor, and Jedi-level patience.   His ability to explain concepts and predict (and resolve) areas of confusion is almost supernatural. Professor Hubbard is the best professor I have ever had. Before this class, I had never really liked math, although I had always been good at it. This class made me want to be a math major and has potentially changed my entire life. Hubbard is an amazing professor and I would recommend everyone who gets a chance to take a course from him.Probably one of the best professors at Cornell or for that matter any where else. He is extremely demanding but you get out what you put in. Take home prelims are terrifying (can take up to 60-100 hours over two weeks) but useful.You will learn an incredible amount in this class. To sum it up: Ravi is a Boss.He is a great lecturer and he keeps class interesting. The only bad thing I have to say about him is that he is not very approachable outside of class. He gives off a &#34;your wasting my time&#34; persona.She explains things very well, and often gave valuable insights, especially when contextualizing things we learnt in class. She left very good comments on the homework sets and was willing to fill any holes that the professor left during lectures. Her discussions were well organized, fun and balanced. The class was much more complete thanks to her.The class is great, so is the professor. I don&#39;t know what else to say, but if you love challenging math this is not a class you want to miss.Interesting character. Literally showed up on Halloween in a dragon costume. Despite his nonstandard notation, bad handwriting, and sometimes unhelpful clarifications (how do you say &#34;decouples&#34; in Chinese? how about &#34;evolves independently over time with respect to its eigen basis?&#34;), he&#39;s always willing to answer questions and is a fine lecturer.My favorite professor. His tests are hard, but he wants his students to learn so he curves the class pretty generously (or so I heard). He said if students want to learn by taking a hard class, they should be rewarded. Helpful, clear, smart, nice guy.Ravi cares about math, he has a wealth of expertise in it, and he knows exactly how to convey that experience to his students. Lectures are riveting - he is the epitome of the classically &#34;great professor&#34; who engages the material in unique ways, while bringing his students along for the ride. He teaches rarely, so take him if you have the chance.Ravi is by far the best professor I&#39;ve had so far, as a lecturer and person. The homework can be brutally difficult and the take-home prelim took be upwards of 60 hours, but 2230 with Ravi will give you a depth of understanding that no other undergraduate math class can. Grading is really tough, but the class was curved very generously.Alright professorDon&#39;t expect more than a 12\/20 on most homeworks or 50 on the prelims, but there&#39;s a GENEROUS curve. Hubbard will go out of his way to help every individual student and his lectures are extremely helpful. Definitely finish the homework over the weekend before it&#39;s due, then seek help.If you ask for help, he will explain until you understand, but you must ask.

Get the answer key and go to Section for HW answers. Don&#39;t expect above a 50 on the prelims (I got an 8 on the 2nd). He assumes you know how to write functions in his notation, functions on complex numbers, functions on matrices, and thorough definitions of derivative and integral.Really difficult class, but Sjamaar is an excellent professor.

That was before this class.  He&#39;s a nice guy, but a horrible  lecturer.  Takes him forever to do an example because he digresses so.He&#39;s such a nice guy but may the worst lecturer ever. You don&#39;t really learn anything in his lectures, and his office hours are just as scatter brained. Genuinely likes his students though, so you can talk to him if you&#39;re struggling in the class. Try to get Strogatz, he&#39;s the best 293 teacher.Above avg professor for the math dept. Very smart professor who is approachableConfusing lecturer, not particularly helpful, and yes very wacky.GO JIMMY JENKINS!! Cool dude, class isnt that hard.He is a great teacher.  Makes everything easier to understand.Professor Jenkins was fantastic!  Very clear, but the writing on the board is constant, so make sure you&#39;ve read it before going to class, so you can absorb it.  Nice, funny guy.Vector calc confused the hell outta me until reading the book.  Other than that, everything was explained okay.  The means on the prelims were very high, and the final was really hard. I studied like crazy for the final but my class grade still sucked.He is a very nice prof, very willing to help out ppl, even if you suck up badly.He is an amazing professor and a great guy. You have to take math 293 for engineering, but he makes you actually want to go.Great professor, makes lecture fun and really wants to help students learn. He is one of the best professors i&#39;ve had at cornell!Hands down the best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell.One of the best math professors I have ever encountered. Very nice, voice is strong and clear, explains material very well.Lots of energy during lecture, easy to stay awake. Honestly cares about his students, very approachable. Prelims were very fair bordering on easy - expect high means. Made 293 seem much easier than 192!Best of the three profs who teach this course (not saying much).  Clear and easy to follow, if somewhat like a robot.  Goes into long-winded example problems that no one can follow.This guy was amusing.  However, prelims were damn near impossible and to this day I&#39;m still not sure how I managed to pass.\n \n Class taken Fall 1997.awesome teacherWell, he is a nice guy, but he is not a good professor in that he has an accent (that no one understands) and teaches strictly by the book (which isn&#39;t one of the better books in the field to begin with). I stopped taking notes and just go along with my textbook. Lectures are not really useful at all (he literally repeats word for word from the book).Awful professor.  I hear he is better with ECE classes, but he is not well suited for teaching larger lectures.  He mumbles, and seemed like he was in his own little world...he would frequently mess up even the most basic problems, even though he had the answers right in front of him.  avoid him if you can.Terrible teacher although he seems genuinely trying to help us. Doesn&#39;t really explain anything and it&#39;s hard to understand him. He has bad handwriting and needs Chalkboard Writing 101.Strogatz is a great professor, hands down. Lectures are as interesting as math can be, and he has a fun personality. One of the better professors I\u2019ve ever had.Horrible lecturer.  Do anything you can to avoid getting him.Rand is god. He is the only prof. at cornell so far that I actually learned from. His lectures are very clear and always inserts comments about applications. He&#39;s Great!!He&#39;s a great lecturer, very easy to follow.  Often times his lectures are not fully relevant to the homework.  I learned neat things about differential equations, but I still had to read every page of the book to do the homework in the last half of the semester.Superb at lecturing-- puts all other profs to shame.  Leading mathematician, yet manages to be crystal clear and helpful in his teaching.  Knows exactly what students have trouble with and will always address these problems during lecture.good guy, watched out for his students.  too bad i HATED 293, otherwise i would have focused on his style more.  nevertheless, a good profAvoid him at all costs.  I only wish I had been able to schedule with a different prof.  There is no point in going to his lectures as he likes to ramble on about nothing for the entire lecture.Phoenix only gets a bad rap because he&#39;s an eccentric old man.  Perhaps not the best at teaching, but he&#39;s very entertaining and gives real world examples.  Very funny - Just wait for his phone to go off in class, maybe it&#39;s NASA calling.  Also, he rips on the annoying kids, like that one girl.  What a B@%ch. Good if you like math and hate her.I second everything negative written below with the addition that he is especially useless and unclear during office hours. He once tried to &#34;help&#34; me with a problem and instead spent the next 30 minutes bumbling around with arithmetic errors. If you get stuck with him, get used to that or try to attend another lecture.He did not do a good job of conveying the material to me in an apprehensive way however, other students found him very enthralling. Prof. R. Rand taught a second lecture, I was hooked on him the first day I went. Text was crucial for me.Hui is a great teacher.  He is funny and his misuse of english is comical.  However, the guy knows his stuff, rarely messes up on the board, and teaches very well.  Also, he uses some good and relevant examples.Good lecturer, very willing to help his students, and very knowledge in many subject areas. The only complaint is that he grades kinda harshly.brilliant person.. just can&#39;t address an audience of people who don&#39;t know the material.Stillman is one of the best teachers I have ever had.  He made differential equations as fun as possible with his lively lectures and examples (&#34;Little Johnny&#34;) and he helped me out when I went to talk to him after bombing the first test.  Take his class if you have the chance!One of the clearest Math professors I&#39;ve had at cornell.  He is fun to listen to, even if it takes a while to get used to.worst professor i have ever had. does not explain anything, does example problems all lecture, and frequently makes mistakes. avoid at all costs.Absolutely the work professor I have ever had. He is not fit for teaching. I don&#39;t go to office hours so I don&#39;t know how helpful he is with that, but in lecture, he is barely able to do one problem, and constantly makes mistakes. Horrible. Avoid him.He is a good guy but plain and simple he cant teach and you have to teach yourself the material. The exams were up and down. You&#39;ll get more from reading the textbook than actually going to lecture.&#34;Muscalu is the greatest&#34;? That&#39;s just plain dangerous.  If you are reading this because you might take a class with Muscalu, DON&#39;T.  Not if you expect lessons in English, to be able to read the chalkboard, or any sort of instruction whatsoever.  I would go so far as to recommend you switch your classes around to avoid him--I sincerely wish I had.Muscalu is the worst professor I&#39;ve had yet at Cornell. His handwriting is an abomination, and his English is at about the same level.  He takes everything straight out of the book, so there&#39;s no point in going to lecture.  The exams are not difficult if you know the material, but it&#39;s not like he helps with that.Worst professot ever.....no point going to the lecture, and just gave us a killing paper for the final.entertaining and nice! one of the best math prof i&#39;ve ever had!Best Math Professor I&#39;ve had yet at Cornell.  Engaging and makes the material clear.Horrible. Scribbles on the board, mumbles something in his accent, just reads from the textbook. Have yet to see somebody who likes him.No CommentsDon&#39;t listen to the positives - those were from some annoying, rude, naive little boys who like to play with numbers instead of girls. If you would like to have a life outside of school, you better get yourself a better professor than Phoenix because he won&#39;t teach you anything. I repeat: he cannot teach. Avoid him at all costs.Read the book, skip lecture, pray for a good TA.He is the MAN!, great course, diff eqn book sucks.Muscalu is the greatest.  The course is rather matter-of-fact if you read the book, so lectures are pointless to begin with.  Furthermore, I honestly would not go to lecture if he weren&#39;t the professor.  Sure, he has trouble conveying his lecture notes, but that is what makes lectures funny and entertaining.  I&#39;m gonna ask him to autograph my book.Stillman is the best example of a professor the Engineering College can ask for. He takes mundane material (diff. equations) and presents it with enthusiasm and wit. He&#39;s funny, approachable, and he knows everything back and forth. Plus, he regularly kills Little Johnny.Horrible proff. Arrogant and annoying. Ruina surely knows how to RuinaClass :)A bit arrogant at times and indulges in self-promotion a lot, but let&#39;s face it, the man knows what he&#39;s talking about and can teach better than just about anybody. Gives a clear picture of the material and makes sure you know how to apply it.He&#39;s really willing to help but his accent and tendancy to mutter makes it really hard to understand sometimes... and often puts me to sleep during lectures.

Comes late in lectures tho.. and finishes late.. kinda funny.. overall a decent professorHui did a great job teaching DiffEq. Always had a clear lecture plan, spoke clearly, great handwriting, and made sure connections between equations were understood before moving on. Exams were mostly re-hashed HW problems (different numbers) up until the final (PDEs). Hard to receive partial credit, but great feedback for missed problems.Class was always packed but it was rather dull. He tried very hard to make it interesting but, we were often bored. All in all, he&#39;s a nice and enthusiastic professor but the book and other resources were essential to learning in this course because his teaching style was difficult to follow.Rand is a hilarious professor who explains things very clearly and grades fairly. I learned a lot from him, and he is my favorite professor at Cornell.Yang&#39;s lectures are basically the textbook, verbatim. While this was somewhat helpful for people who didn&#39;t read the textbook, as somebody who was trying to gain a better understanding of the material by going to lecture, I found myself disinterested rather than engaged.At times, lectures were all over the place, but I ultimately learned a lot about differential equations from Sachse. The class was geared towards engineers and Sachse would always present examples of real applications of the topics learned in class which was nice. Finally, Sachse was very high energy and humorous during lecture.Professor Berest followed the textbook very closely, and if you paid attention in class, was very helpful. A lot of students don&#39;t like his lectures, but they were useful as long as you didn&#39;t slack off yourself. The exams were challenging but doable if you keep up with the homework, and this class was much better than MATH 1920.He&#39;s good. The lectures are clear and  well structured.I learn by lectures, so they were helpful to me, but many of my friends didn&#39;t find them necessary. The course starts off pretty slow, so it can fall into the trap of having an easy first prelim, and then much harder second prelim\/final just for the sake of trumping students and separating out the curve, so beware.The lectures was pretty funny, and midterms was relatively okay. I admit though that I had a bit of a problem with the way he graded the midterm. He gave everybody a full score on a question, giving advantage to people who score low on the question. Oh, and final was hard, but you should expect that in Cornell.His explanations are perfectly clear, and apart from being a brilliant professor, he is an excellent teacher. His exams are fair. I would highly recommend Strogatz for any course here at Cornell.Best professor I had yet. Teaching is clear and tests are simply a reflection of lectures and hw...nothing unreasonable.Funny guy, decent lecturer, fair examsRand is a great professor. He makes what seems like pretty boring stuff really interesting. He always shows how the math we&#39;re learning in differential equations applies to topics in engineering. I failed the second prelim and then did decent on the final, and ended up with a surprisingly good grade, so he grades pretty nicely. Professor is very good at explaining course material and answers any questions in-lecture. Doesn&#39;t, however, cover anything that is not in the textbook, in principle. Sometimes decides to make some jokes, which are usually pretty funny. Overall, a fine professor.He loved to prove theorems and only devote a small amount of time to teaching what you need to know for the HW and tests. His explanations weren&#39;t very helpful but at least he brought in a few items to illustrate a few concepts in 3D. Best to take what he teaches and fill in the many conceptual gaps on your own.Good lectures, assigns an appropriate amount of homework to teach the material. Often falls behind the lecture schedule however.Knowledgeable but sometimes cannot convey what it is hes trying to teach us. Also pretty bland, not that math is exciting but at least liven up a little.He was a great lecturerExcellent lecturer, but not very good at writing the exams. Homework is fair.Favorite Professor for now! Great lecturer, cracks hilarious jokes, tests are easy and reflects homework well.Dude&#39;s a legend. Takes time after class to explain anything you had problems with. Yeah the homework is a lot for sure, and he expects some basic fluency in excel\/python for some assignments, but he&#39;s really good at introducing Differential Equations. Handled the online transition like a champ too (Spring 2020)Meh. His lectures are pretty boring and not fruitful, although he is a pretty nice guy and has a good sense of humor. Also, made midterms super-hard because last year&#39;s mean was too high in his opinion.He is one of the &#34;star&#34; professors at Cornell, but he sure is not a &#34;star&#34; instructor. He is intelligent, has insights, and so on - but he is not able to communicate his thoughts effectively &amp; correctly. Plus, why does he make students memorize trig formulas and geometry formulas for DiffEq exams? I guess that adds &#34;stubborn&#34; to his teaching style.I find him to be extremely rude.  He shows up late to office hours (the day before an exam!!), and left a few minutes early after cutting off a question because he wanted to go home.  Overrated in my opinionGreat Professor!  One of the best I&#39;ve taken so far.Alex Townsend has clear lecturers but expects us to apply a lot that we learned on exams.By far the best professor that I have had here at Cornell. I even bought his book.Could not ask for a better professor. Explanations are ridiculously clear even in the most confusing subject matter. Funny, and always makes class interesting. Rewards hard work by making tests a lot like homework and weighting homework heavily.Townsend really expects a lot from and cares a lot for his students. He is amazing at explaining things in lecture and during office hours. His exams were conceptual and I found them difficult.LOVE strogatz. funny, fair, and makes math interesting (hard to believe, i know). my favorite professor at cornellTerrible professor. Used powerpoint from textbook (aka written by the textbook authors), and didn&#39;t even bother reading over it before class and consistently found mistakes in it during class. Yelled at students to ask questions because as a professor, he shouldn&#39;t just speak the whole lecture, it should be run by students asking questions...Uses Powerpoint in teaching math.. not really helpful in writing notes. Exams are tough.Amazing professor! At first I wasn&#39;t sure about Townsend, but he changed the lecture style as the course went on and I found myself so engaged by midsemester; the type of engaged where you forget to take notes because you are so absorbed. Yes, the prelims were hard. But in the end I learned so much from this class, a few points off meant nothing.Vladimirsky is great! He taught 2930 (but not other classes) using ppt slides from the textbook, but wrote out things that needed further explaining on the board. Even though there were 200+ people in this class, he took the time to answer every single question, so you have no excuses, lol. He also has a cool Russian accent. Would recommend!Vladimirsky is very tough and expects a lot out of students.  However, he knows and can teach differential equation incredibly well.  What&#39;s great is that he forces us to think beyond the material that we were learning in class and analyze the assumptions that we make in our discussions. He actually wants people to ask questions in class.I understand that Prof. Townsend has an incredible experience in the area of Mathematics, but I feel like he&#39;s just too smart to teach it to anyone. His explanations are obscure; he writes down equations, often not explaining how he derived them. 10 minutes of Khan Academy explained exact equations to me better than 1 hour of his lectures. Awful.Horrible presentation of material; cumbersome and counter-intuitive explanations; boring lectures. A very bad prof. Hopefully never get him again.He literally wrote a practice final just because the students demanded him to. Also, he is very active on piazza, and takes the student&#39;s feedbacks very seriously throughout the semester. His teaching style isn&#39;t for everyone: he focuses on a lot of cool real life applications during lectures, and some students don&#39;t like it. I loved it a lot.His homeworks and exams are hard but I really enjoyed his amazing lectures. He is always so excited to teach and listens to student feedback. I learned a lot this semester from him.Townsend is one of the most caring people I&#39;ve ever met. He responds to feedback throughout the semester to improve the course. Lectures contain everything you need to know to do well (I never read the textbook), and include interesting real-world applications. Exams were very difficult but he curves generously so it works out alright.The most dedicated math professor. His class changed my attitude towards math. He handed out the lecture notes early, which was very helpful. A very rewarding class.His explanations are super clear and I actually found his lectures very insightful because he brought up many interesting real-life problems and how diffeq could be applied to derive models to solve those problems. Even when the class went online, he still managed the course logistics very well. It was my most favorite class for Spring 2020.Tough but rewarding. Some lectures are hit-or-miss. Overall not bad though. I would not dread taking the class again. If you take 2930, you might need to know how to program and graph for some homework assignments.Clumsy during lecture. Unclear objectives. Makes condescending jokes. Mean and loud. Exams were graded unfairly. Test questions were about as well put together as his lectures.Assigns way too many problems for homework, get ready for over 20 pages of problems that really are just a waste of your paper. Doesn&#39;t teach well, gets most examples from Paul&#39;s Math Notes. Since moving to online (Spring 2020), the class has become a nuisance.Strogatz is a funny guy. He was also a great lecturer and knew how to break down concepts crystal clear while capturing the class&#39;s attentions (just sit down in one lecture and listen to his witty\/hilarious remarks). Homework and prelims were fair, final exam was killer. My friends and I didn&#39;t find him too friendly during office hours though..Strogatz is the best Math prof I have had at Cornell by far.  He is very good at explaining things and he tests very fairly.  He is also very funny and will not bore you in class.He&#39;s really boring. I usually end up sleeping in this class and read the textbook later. He makes a bunch of math mistakes too.Real funny guy, makes entertaining lectures.The level of difficulty of the three exams were all very different. The two prelims were easy but the final was very hard. Lecture was not very helpful - you can teach yourself the course just fine by reading the textbook. Lectures were often more confusing than they were insightful. Average amount of homework at an average level of difficulty.He&#39;s so greatA wonderful human being, having Strogatz for a professor is like having your friend&#39;s cool dad teach you math.She doesn&#39;t understand that a lot of people do not care about mechanical engineering and how diff eq applies mostly to physics\/mechE stuff. We just need the math requirement and will never use that material againBest damn teacher alive!AAZING professor.  I think he is the best that I have had at Cornell so far.  Always makes the class laugh and is very clear.good luck with himHis teaching style and delivery was dry and uninspiring for the most part. Compared to some other teachers I&#39;ve had at Cornell, he didn&#39;t seem very excited about what he was teaching. His pedagogy skills weren&#39;t very noteworthy. Sometimes his decent sense of humor would come through, or he&#39;d talk about something interesting unrelated to diff eq.Tells subtle but great jokesGood prof, explains things pretty clearly, but by no means goes in detail.  Teaches how to solve problems, but no more, so all context of problems is lost.  Not hugely interesting, either.  Nice guy though, and very understanding.terrible lectures - hes unclear and goes off on tangents. youre better off taking the AEW and not showing up to class. wait until you can fit strogatzs class into your schedule and take it with him.","difficulty":3.0967741935,"rating":3.6612903226},{"index":3809,"prof_name":"Leigh Phoenix","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"MATH293DE","comment":"Great prof.

Every day he&#39;ll walk into lecture, start talking and I feel like passing out after 5 mins because of his unclairity and randomness.  LEARN TO TEACH!!Not one of the best math294 profs, but he&#39;s clear and will probably keep you awake.  He gives light homework (several problem sets had under six problems) and tests weren&#39;t too hard either.went from &#34;i gotta drop this class&#34; (pre-Hui) to &#34;i actually know what i&#39;m doing&#34; (post-Hui). He&#39;s awesome, his lectures are damn straightforward, and he does some examples. very neat handwriting...:)He taught the material very clearly and made a difficult subject pretty straight-forward and easy to understand. He gave me my first A at Cornell!He&#39;s definitely familiar with the materials, but the way he teaches it is not all that clear. If you spend the effort to go to his lectures, do all the homework problems, and read the textbook, you&#39;ll do well. Really funny prof, I&#39;ve never seen anyone getting so worked up just for Linear Algebra!I was trying to learn the materials from the lecture but I eventually realized that wasn&#39;t gonna happen with this prof, so I just learnt from the book...  well I understand it&#39;s hard to teach linear algebra...funny guy, but you&#39;ll need to learn from book cause linear algebra makes absolutely no sense in generalGood professor, take this class with him if you can.Hui is a very good teacher. He conveys a seemingly complex material in a very simple fashion, and prepares you well for his prelims.If you go to class,take good notes,and read the book,you should be able to do very well in his class. Prelims were fairly simple and straightforward,though the final was fairly difficult. Overall though,a great teacherawesome guy. Tough exams and hw but a very interesting lecturer and funny guy. Clear lectures and knows his stuff. One of the best professors I&#39;ve had hereInteresting professor, you&#39;d be hard pressed to fall asleep in his class as he is very enthusiastic about teaching. The actual teaching is rather lacking as it comes straight out of the book.Hui rules. You must experience the phenomenon before you graduate. There were some hard-to-follow lectures, but for the most part he made the course clear and easy.  Also, by far the funniest prof I&#39;ve had.I dont understand why people would love Hui.  He was an alright teacher, teaching straight out of the book - derivation then equation, etc etc.  the book gets you thru the course, Hui is really nothing specialI don&#39;t understand why everyone likes him.  He was not a good teacher, and all his examples came straight from the book.  And I CERTAINLY had no problem falling asleep during his lectures...No CommentsI will never wear a turtleneck again. Oh, and he&#39;s horrible lecturer.An ok teacher.  He&#39;s pretty funny, but I still have trouble staying awake through class.Thought he was great for the first few weeks, and then realized he was terrible.  Going to his class is basically like reading an out-of-print 60 year old textbook.  Every class he picks up mid-sentence where he left off the class before - doesn&#39;t take time to clarify where he&#39;s starting from.  Too bad though - I really enjoyed math 192 &amp; 293.Learned nothing...and what is with the damn turtlenecks (wore everyday)?HE TALKS TO HIMSELF. HE WRITES HORRIBLY, YOU SPEND YOUR ENTIRE LECTURE TIME TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HE IS SAYING AND WHAT HE IS WRITING ON THAT BOARD IN FRONT OF YOU. I THINK IVE SAID ENOUGH...... IF YOU HAVE THIS PERSON AS YOUR PROF, PLEASE, DO ME A FAVOR AND GET ANOTHER ONE FOR THE SAME COURSE OR IF NO ONE ELSE IS AVAILABLE JUST SKIP THE CLASS!Very funny guy, and its not easy to make linear algebra humerous... there was one spontaneous ovation for him one friday morning, no idea how or why, but makes the class worth taking.Mumbles, doesn&#39;t seem familiar with topic.  Makes &#34;chalk errors&#34; that students have to correct, even when copying from prepared notes.  Very slow and monotonous lectures.  Not many alternatives here, but this is not a lecturer you&#39;d want to learn from.  Apparently big difference from the ECE class, perhaps due to huge class sizes.One of the best professors Ive had at Cornell. He is also very kind to his students. Lectures are engaging and sometimes funny. Just look at all the previous posts.. not a single negative review.No CommentsHe&#39;s just the frickin best!!Ruina gets a bad rep from students but i really like him-- he&#39;s kinda wackyFunny as hell...have to give him that. A pretty bad teacher, but the book was understandable.Phoenix was NOT A GOOD math professor. And I don&#39;t say that to be mean -- he seems like a pretty stand-up, classy guy who cares for his family and crack jokes; he just can&#39;t teach. I could have taught the class more coherently.Really funny.

Literally read the powerpoint slides he puts up and you will be better prepared as he is not a good lecturer.He&#39;s...well, he&#39;s not exactly the most interesting professor ever. Pretty much just did other HW in his class and learned everything from the book. The participation grade is really the only reason to go in the first place.Very dry and unclear lecturer. First exam was super easy, the other two, not as much. By the end of the semester, attendance was probably less than 50%. Should avoid if possible.Sure, his lectures may not have been the most interesting, but it&#39;s math, I&#39;ve yet to have a lecturer that makes this stuff super engaging. I actually thought he was pretty funny, which kept me listening. And the prelims were based on homework and lecture material, so if you know all that, you should be completely fineHe&#39;s the kind of professor who likes to screw students up. The average of first prelim was a C+, he thought the mean was too high and decided to make the following prelims a lot harder.Really didn&#39;t seem interested in teaching the course. Lectures were very dull and at times could be condescending, office hours weren&#39;t very helpful either. Tests very proof based for an engineering math class and watch out for the truefalse questions. Material seemed to repeat itself after the first prelim. Most didn&#39;t go to class mid semesterPlease don&#39;t take any math courses with this instructor i.e. MATH 2940. It&#39;s important for every students to know about this instructor because he doesn&#39;t care about students. He doesn&#39;t know what is he teaching because lot of time he goes through the book in the middle of the lecture. He speaks French most of the time, and his English isn&#39;t great.I took this course this Fall, and he made this course absolutely difficult to pass an exam. Linear Algebra isn&#39;t a bad course,but he isn&#39;t the greatest,as he can&#39;t communicate with students. He comes off aggressive, mean, and sometimes tear students down. His teaching style is like going through a book and doing better.I won&#39;t take his any advice.If you take this course with this instructor then you won&#39;t pass, and you won&#39;t learn anything from him. Linea Algebra isn&#39;t a hard class, but he made this class extremely hard. He doesn&#39;t help any students to see themselves or help them succeed. He is divisive when it comes to helping and assigns bad TA at the same time.He talks way too fast. Tests are way harder than the practice ones he gives you.Pretty lousy lectures, I did all of my learning from reading the textbook. Both prelims were not very difficult but the final was ridiculous. If this guy teaches linear algebra again get ready to teach yourself everything.Would consider taking that class another semester if you can, if Townsend is teaching. He has an amazing personality, puts in a lot of effort into teaching and cares about his students. However, his exams are brutally difficult. There were questions that you won&#39;t be ready to solve unless you&#39;re a math major. I was stressed out all sem cause of himI loved the way he lectured. He used powerpoints to summarize important information and then wrote on the board. It was awesome to be able to miss a math class and not fall super behind because there is no way to access lecture info. The exams were very fair and reflected the material he heavily covered.Maybe I&#39;m sympathetic to Professor Saloff-Coste because I took French in high school, but I think he gets a bad rap. I just had to read the book to supplement his lectures. The course went from being laughably easy on the first two prelims to nearly impossible on the (I&#39;m guessing curved) final, so hopefully he finds a balance next time.His lectures were very clear. He taught the material well enough in lecture that I always felt prepared when it came to the homework, quizzes, and tests.Lectures weren&#39;t very insightful, just read the textbook.Prof Davis is always so willing to help and take feedback, and he&#39;s just a great teacher in general.I&#39;d go easy on him. Yes, he has a thick French accent but his English is easily understandable. I don&#39;t know what everybody is talking about saying that he is unhelpful or mean. To me he comes across as really polite and caring. I had never had a problem with him per se,but I agree that he made the midterms very easy but the opposite on the finalLectures are helpful insofar as they help walk through and preview the material, but it&#39;s pretty common for students in engineering math classes to forgo lectures, basically regardless of who the professor is. When I took it, the course started off pretty easy, and then the final exam was made really hard so as to spread out the grade distribution.I went to lecture a few times at the beginning of the semester but stopped because the book is amazing to learn out of. If the prelims are too easy he can curve down pretty hard so cross your fingers and don&#39;t make any mistakes. He tends to make the A range small and while making the B\/C range really bigThe textbook was 100 times more useful than the lectures. His lectures were difficult to understand and often didn&#39;t make sense or were irrelevant to what we were &#34;supposed&#34; to be learning that day. Prelims were too easy and curved down- a 95% became a B on the second one.I went to a few of his lectures and they were clear and organized. He is great in explaining the material in office hours.Most memorable thing is his stutters during lecture and his really tight &amp; sexy sweaters. Also his really off-mark jokes (in his Russian accent) are pretty funny. Has powerpoints online in case you&#39;re lazy, but answers questions during class readily, so it&#39;s worth it. Prelim &amp; finals are both ridiculously easy.He literally copy pastes questions from the textbook for his test questions. Nice Meme.His lectures introduced the material necessary for the homework and exams. They weren&#39;t very interesting and he&#39;s not the most engaging speaker. His exams were inconsistent in level of difficulty but definitely took a lot of cues from the HW sets.tests were mostly based on hw, but got extremely hard for the final. study the hw!You could tell that Professor Townsend was passionate about the subject and wanted to teach the class the best that he could. His lectures were well-prepared, enjoyable, and he is humorous. I really appreciate that we were able to give him feedback on notecards early in the semester and he implemented those changes.Pretty standard course: weekly homework set, weekly quiz. She&#39;s an extremely mediocre (boring) lecturer, but I stopped going to lecture after a few times anyway because everything is in the textbook. I forgot about the first prelim, bombed it, and still managed a B overall; the material is not hard as long as you keep up with the work.The class is mostly online this semester, but he teaches with a chalkboard and webcam. His lectures make me realize that I greatly miss in-person classes. His lectures are fun to watch and structured. I am finding that I need to read the textbook very closely.I&#39;m kind of surprised by most of the reviews. I enjoyed his lectures and I liked that he had a lot of examples that were easy to follow. The exams weren&#39;t hard, and he allowed a cheat sheet which really helped. Pretty friendly guy too.Read off the slides during lecture that he posted online, tests were confusing and nothing like the homework.Confusing lecturer; I stopped going to lecture since the textbook for this class is pretty good so I relied on that instead. She was an accomodating professor, extending deadlines when people requested, and had a good sense of humor but these really couldn&#39;t compensate for her mediocre teaching. Prelims were reasonable.I can assure you, there&#39;s a huge chance that after the first few weeks, you stop attending this man&#39;s class. He is basically useless, and you learn everything from the textbook. He also has really mean negative grading true and false questions that mess a lot of people up. If you have a choice, take it with another professor.Townsend is a great prof. He tries to make his lectures accessible, whether via humor or real-world applications, and attempts to incorporate student feedback into the course, which is more than I can say for 80% of the other professors I&#39;ve had at Cornell. If you can choose between taking 2940 with Townsend and someone else, choose Townsend.Professor Townsend was one of the best professors I&#39;ve had at Cornell. His lectures are clear and engaging; even though the class was online this semester, he encouraged participation and paused often to answer our questions. His exams and homework assignments were very fair.He truly cares about the subject, and this shows through his engaging and well-structured lectures that heavily aided my understanding. He is very accessible outside of class via email or on Piazza, where he gives detailed responses and encourages students who are concerned about the course. His tests are challenging, but he curves generously.Townsend&#39;s lectures are very well put together- you can tell he puts a lot of time into thinking about the best way to present topics. Easily the most engaging math lectures I&#39;ve had. The prelims\/homeworks were also very fair. The only parts of the course that weren&#39;t that good were those managed by the TAs, like discussions and quizzes.Professor Townsend, with his witty humor (both during lectures as well as on our Piazza discussion board), embedded real-life applications into his crystal-clear lectures, leaving me with a newfound confidence in myself and a deeper appreciation for the beauty of mathematics.Excellent Lecturer. Engaging with the class; has a few quirky jokes every class. Grade is over 80% based on tests and quizzes.My absolute favorite professor at Cornell. Lively, entertaining, and understanding that sometimes students just don&#39;t get it. Always cracked jokes in class and turned a relatively mundane subject into something I really enjoyed! I actually looked forward to lecture every day and never missed one. Highly recommend this professor.He&#39;s great! Best math prof I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Very enthusiastic and easy to follow; sometimes forgets to explain basic concepts but might just assume that we&#39;ve been keeping up on the reading ourselves! I would definitely recommend this professor for engineering math.He was better than the other teacher teaching the class. Format for lecture was example based and he explained things well. Homework varied and was usually a bit harder than necessary, and sometimes not very useful to prepare for the test. Tests were difficult, but curved of course.Lectures not very clear, reading the textbook is more useful. Very weak stance on cheating. Instead of taking proper disciplinary actions, she only &#34;gave a low score on the question that the student cheated on&#34;. Insisted that only 1 question was uploaded on Chegg, when students provided links that showed the whole exam and solutions were uploaded.Awesome prof. Always energized, crystal clear examples, logical flow. I don&#39;t love math but he makes linear algebra understandable. Lectures are really useful, and way preferable to learning from the book. Very nice, responsive to feedback, engaging. Fair exams, fair amount of homework, reasonable class. Would recommend highly!Lectures were the worst. Stumbled all the time and confused herself. My linear algebra skills are lacking because of her. It took her a whole class to explain something and I was still confused. My TA explained it in five minutes and everything was clear. Assignments were fair.Great teacher. Explains material with ease to the class. He makes Linear Algebra interesting.   The final is worth 40% of the class though, so messing up on that can ruin all the work you put in the class for months.I love this guy. He&#39;s hilarious in a unique way, and he made linear algebra incredibly accessible. He&#39;s a little on the quiet speaking side, as he preferred not to use a mic my semester (so sit closer if you can), but he&#39;s very thorough and approachable. His lectures were clear and he was always ready to help students. Highly recommended.pretty decent. fairly clear but sometimes confusing. overall solid teacherdecent!I didn&#39;t really appreciate the lectures very much and the textbook really sucks at teaching you stuff. I don&#39;t know why, but I felt the first exam was the hardest (maybe I didn&#39;t get it at first). Then, the second prelim and final had A LOT of homework problems on them and weren&#39;t too bad. Study the homeworks if you have Hui as your professor.Hui is a really nice guy, gets so excited about the material. His notes are usually pretty clear and straightforward, but I still had to learn from the book a lot.Great guy, gets right to the material I switched into this class from math 2210 (other lin alg) and this class was so much better compared to 2210Simply an amazing professor. Extremely nice and down to earth. You can tell he loves the subject (some of the comments he makes on theorems\/proofs are hilarious) and does an excellent job breaking down subjects. Very approachable too during office hours and helped\/encouraged me greatly. I wish I&#39;d have him again if I take another math class.Ravi is the best professor I&#39;ve ever had at Cornell. He is a fantastic teacher, always makes sure everyone understands, and really cares about the material and his students. He&#39;s really clear, but takes every question seriously and will always answer them. He&#39;s very down to earth and nice, and altogether just a great guy. Take his classes!!Great guy; great prof. Ravi, If you&#39;re reading this, I really appreciate all you do to help your students. Your lecture is the highlight of my day. It&#39;s been really refreshing to have you! Bravo!Ravi is a boss. He&#39;s definitely the best math professor I&#39;ve ever had and arguably the best profs at Cornell. He&#39;s extremely clear and approachable. Frankly he&#39;s a really cool guy and loves the subject. He&#39;s challenging, but in a way that makes you want to learn the material. Bottom line: YOU&#39;D BE LUCKY TO MEET HIM LET ALONE HAVE HIM AS A PROF!Ravi is a great professor. He gives out sweaters to people who participate in lecture. Ravi is an actual mathematician, but he teaches to an engineering audience and provides a lot of real-life examples. Out of 1910-20-2930-40, I thought this class was the easiest. I would be interested in taking an actual math class with Ravi and do recommend him.Professor Back is a pretty friendly professor.  He was open to many questions during class.  Sometimes his explanations were not very clear, but those were the rare occasions.  Typically, Back knows and explains the material well.  Also, his prelims are generally straightforward with few curve balls.Spring 2019, Median: B. His lectures were theoretical; exam questions were mixed theoretical and applied (light proofs), like his homework. Some students stopped going to lecture because the textbook was closer to the exams. lectures were mostly boring but occasionally cool. I learned a lot but its an easy course, so I cant fully credit him.First the first couple of weeks, his lectures were clear, and verbatim of the textbook. He really did make the textbook extremely straightforward. However, as time progressed, his lectures became extremely confusing, and the majority of the stuff he was teaching was nowhere to be found in the textbook. Read the textbook and you should be fine.Jumps around topics like crazy, often mumbles to himself in the middle of example problems while the class just sits there and is unaware of what he is trying to do. Fortunately LinAlg isn&#39;t too complex and the book (Lay) wasn&#39;t terrible, but definitely could have had better examples in it to make up for poor lectures. Exams were average.Ravi is the man. He sincerely wants everyone to do well, and is super helpful.

If you don&#39;t enjoy math, you might find Prof. Wu&#39;s lectures a little dry; but, he is thorough and precise. Also, great textbook.This is the first year he taught Analysis. While it wasn&#39;t bad, it certainly wasn&#39;t good; while he makes lectures enjoyable, he ended up spending a lot of time on material that wasn&#39;t ultimately necessary (like failed historical proofs) while glossing over much more important info. Awful book, awful TA, and lectures weren&#39;t as rigorous as his HW.Wong made a topic as complex as analysis easy to understand and follow. There was no point in this class where I felt lost, and Wong explains the hardest concepts with such amazing clarity and understanding. He is also available outside of class for personal help. Nothing he tests is unfair or not taught; if you pay attention, you&#39;ll do fine.Great lecturer, very approachable. Homework wasn&#39;t too bad if you start early. Tests were fair.The material is fairly easy, but he always makes it more intuitive, more in depth or helps to clarify some points that would be easily mistaken. And some of his lectures are really cool and he talked about proofs that aren&#39;t in the book and are either really interesting or useful in the future.A nice person, but not a great lecturer.Prof. Saloff-Coste is a great lecturer; he makes concepts intuitive and easy to understand. Outside of class, he&#39;s very approachable, and he holds frequent office hours. Even after office hours, he would email me with extra details that we didn&#39;t get to cover, which I really appreciated. Overall amazing professor!Made real analysis super interesting yet built our foundation of the subject. It is his first time teaching as a professor yet he is highly organized and willing to help. Difficulty of course is due to nature of content, but he tries to show the motivation for every result. He taught many topics normally not taught, such as Lebesgue integration.Professor Gomez really cares about his students. He guides through the subject step by step. Exam should be fine if you can do homework thoroughly by yourself. Analysis is dense subject, so it was a lot of fun with proving theorems logically and rigorously by myself. If you like thinking analytically, this course serves its purpose.Prof. Gomez is a very helpful professor and his efforts in class and office hours certainly show that he cares about the learning of his students. The class homeworks and tests were pretty fair overall and I certainly developed a keen interest in analysis from the course. Definitely one of the better professors I have had at CornellProfessor Gomez was one of the best professors I have had at Cornell. Analysis can be difficult if not taught properly. Gomez stressed the intuition of the concepts, and it made Analysis very enjoyable. Definitely recommend his classes. Very willing to help students.Professor Gomez did an awesome job with Real Analysis.  Lectures were great, homework lengthy but very helpful to reinforce material.  Professor Gomez was great answering questions in lecture as well as in office hours.  Really one of the best young professors in Cornell&#39;s Math department.Analysis is definitely a difficult course, but Prof. Hwang was able to relate the information in an accessible manner, especially considering he was a brand new professor.  In office hours, he was always willing to help make sense out of the information and had very convenient and many hours available.","difficulty":3.2307692308,"rating":4.6923076923},{"index":3815,"prof_name":"Richard Rand","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"MATH3230","comment":"Awesome","difficulty":2,"rating":5},{"index":3816,"prof_name":"Allen Hatcher","prof_dept":"Mathematics","class_name":"MATH3320","comment":"He made the number theory class really interesting.

Tends to spend alot of time proving concepts, but balances it out with alot of examples that help apply the concepts. Homeworks are very tough compared to the exams and in-class material, and they make up a large portion of your grade. But, the exams are very easy.

Puts an incredible amount of efforts into preparing for class and helping students. Explains things clearly and concisely so try not to miss lectures. Truly cares about his students. Questions are always welcome and help is available almost whenever. Much-appreciated accommodations were made during covid19.Terrible. Exams aren&#39;t representative of what you learn in class. Homeworks are too easy so you aren&#39;t sufficiently prepared for the material. The Professor is nearly incomprehensible sometimes because he keeps rambling on and doesn&#39;t connect topics.Avoid at all costs. Worst math professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Handwriting is illegible, prelims are nearly impossible, and does not teach the concepts well at all.She&#39;s a nice person but just not good at teaching... Her lecture is not well organized and her notes are very unclear. She seems to be a happy, helpful person and she tries...  I found the lectures not helpful at all and just learned most of material from the textbook. The book is very good and cover all the material fairly clearly.Aguiar was so lovely. He encourages students to ask questions and tries to link the class to real-world examples. He has a good grasp of how much students can viably absorb in one class and usually doesn&#39;t try to overstuff the class.Like another commenter said, she is a nice person, but her lectures are quite poor. She&#39;ll often ask the class a question, then wait about 5 minutes in silence for someone to figure it out, and when no one does, she just gives the answer. This can happen about 1-3 times per lecture.The lectures were confusing sometimes but he generally did a good job. The most accessible and easy to talk to professor I&#39;ve had here. Explains things very thoroughly one-on-one.I think she is a very good lecturer. Her lectures are clear and organized and summarize all the important points in the textbook. Homeworks are not always straightforward, but they are in general a lot of fun! Enjoy this class very much!He is brilliant, but his lectures are not quite relevant to textbook. Homework are just easy questions from book, and exams are doable if you do understand the materials well. Take his class if you are good at math and you will learn a lot.

His lectures are pretty pointless since he mostly reads from his notes that are online anyway. However, those notes (which he wrote) are pretty good. Tests are pretty easy. Homeworks are a bit harder and kind of long but not terrible.Has a bit of accent and a slightly sloppy handwriting, but still one of the most brilliant lecturer in cornell math\/cs. Very elegantly lays out the proofs in class; he tries to teach students to &#34;smell&#34; the intuition behind each proof. Weekly homeworks are medium to mildly challenging; take-home exams can be slightly challenging.I know this guy is brilliant, but he can&#39;t teach for his life.  Very unclear, rambles and cannot answer questions.  The class isn&#39;t so hard, though.Prof. Nerode is kind, approachable, understanding, and overall just a great man! The fact that he&#39;s still teaching at the age of 81 explains why his lectures can at times be a bit difficult to follow. But he was very understanding when it came to prelim conflicts so he has my utmost respect. Would definitely take any other class with him!Prof. Muscalu is one of the best maths professors at Cornell university. His honor analysis series along with abstract algebra by Prof. Allen Knutson are the most challenging and rewarding maths courses I have ever taken at Cornell.I think he&#39;s better at teaching history of mathematics\/logic than analysis. Classes are usually unclear and it doesn&#39;t seem to make much of a difference if you go or not since reading the book by yourself gives pretty much the same result.

Can be a bit hand-wavey at times but a solid introduction. Not the best lecturer but he really tries to answer any questions you have and is very accessible.goodLectures can be very boring- you better like the stuff so you don&#39;t doze off. Not really hard stuff, just pay attention in lectures and u don&#39;t really have to review anything at home. Problem sets are short just weird so make sure you can make it to office hours to ask for help if u do that you can spend as little as 2h\/wk outside for this class.Great professor. Very clear that he&#39;s interested in teaching and inspiring students, i.e. lectures are not some sort of hassle that gets in the way of his &#39;real&#39; work.

Homework isn&#39;t bad, labs are usually really quick (eg 15-20 minutes), lab writeups okay. 1010Very friendly and approachable professor. Extremely helpful if you are having problems on labs, homeworks, or just on general concepts. I personally found his lectures a little boring, but he is very clear and is just a fun professor in the lecture room. For the course, labs are quick and fun. Write ups slightly time consuming but not bad.Lectures were very boring and I did not get much out of them.  A lot of topics weren&#39;t explained that well and he assumed you already knew a good deal about what he was teaching (I didn&#39;t). It wasn&#39;t toooo hard to get a good grade if you put in the effort, but only take the class if you&#39;re genuinely interested in the subject and willing to do so.I took this Intro to Engineering class because I was interested in the future of energy and wanted to get a general introduction to the material science field.

You can ask him literally any question in his field and he will be able to answer you.

If you take the course seriously, Rich will go above and beyond. He is extremely caring.This professor&#39;s demeanor in lecture was very inappropriate for any healthy learning environment.My biggest regret as a business minor was choosing to take finance with Curtis.

Dedicated to teaching, and to your understanding the material. Can play hard ass, but is actually very forgiving when &#39;real life&#39; gets in the way.Hard to describe -- great at explaining complex and abstract ideas (really good), but can be a bit abrasive (if you&#39;re not into his style of &#39;humor&#39;). Very fair grading system.Best prof I have ever had at Cornell. Would take more classes with Evan, but they conflict with my schedule. Demanding, funny, very fair. Almost perfect evaluation system (regular assignments that are super helpful), and unlimited time exams.Most unusual prof I&#39;ve ever had. Amazingly clear, most awesome lecture notes ever (better than a textbook), and absolutely no connection to what I would have imagined for an Ivy League professor. Exams were tough, but fair.

He&#39;s an awesome lecturer and a really cool guy in person. So cool, he has coffee with whomever wants to join him every Wednesday after class. No other prof does that I know of does that.Overall he is an interesting lecturer, and I have never gotten bored in his class.  Although he does make some mistakes at time, everyone&#39;s entitled to at points.He is the worst prof I&#39;ve had. He pays more attention to the &#34;show&#34; aspect of lecture, than to the content. Words are constantly mispelled and the content is often wrong. He may be a well established researcher, but it certainly doesn&#39;t show inNo CommentsNo CommentsThe class time is right after lunch so very it&#39;s very tempting to fall asleep. The material is all in the textbook so not need to go to lecture (therefore the lectures are rather boring). The exams are hard! Its all True\/False...Levitsky&#39;s an entertaining professor. Really enjoyed his class; had a lot of great material that is relevent to our lives and he is so awesome.  The class isn&#39;t too hard if you do the work, but losts of memorization. Still best class and prof i had so farThis rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.lively, straight-forward, personable professor. his exams are T\/F, so beware- but they&#39;re also pretty straight forward even for T\/F. if there are 2 right answers, he only credits those who bring it to his attention, so form a review group with friends or something. class material is something that will help you in everyday living.i heart professor levitsky.No Commentspossibly the stupidest professor at cornellHe is very animated in teaching nutrition, and tries hard to illustrate the concepts and ideas he&#39;s teaching, but sometimes, he overdoes things, like running around lecture the lecture hall. The big paper really depends on the TA. Hope you get one who wouldn&#39;t mark you down for stupid little mistakes.he has a phd in psychology. wtf is he doing teaching nutrition...Really Great Teacher!! Made me very interested in nutrition. Now I am concentrating in Nutrition.I loved Prof Levitsky. He was just really into teaching us his passion and it showed. I could ask him any question pertaining to nutrition and he always had an answer whether it was something we covered or not. He often flipped through the slides too quickly, but you could get them on the internet.Good lectures.  Good entertainment value.  Good content.  Teacher is enthusiastic and well educated in the topic of nutrition and this class is one you will get a lot out of.This class was okay, but all test are T\/F which is ridiculous. Levitsky is a nice and helpful guy, but the class shows some bias and keep in mind, the man is a vegetarian.Dr. Levitsky is the manhe might seem a little nuts often time but i have to admit it&#39;s an easy class. Just go to lecture and write down everything he says. the tests are all from the notes and there&#39;s absolutely no need to purchase the book by the way.Nice guy, very laid back\/funny and a dynamic lecturer, but the class is harder than it should be. Tests are all true\/false and he marks you down on essays for really minor details.Levitsky rocks. I tend to fall asleep in class a lot because it&#39;s right after lunch, but he is so nice and his lectures are funny. I had to hand in a paper an hour late and I gave him this whole breathless explanation (cuz I ran to catch him) and he just took it and said &#34;it&#39;s ok&#34;. I LOVE HIM!!!The class wasn&#39;t too hard. The average was a B+. The prelim averages were around a C+ but almost everyone got A&#39;s on the term paper, which brough the grades up. The prelims were 90% true\/false and Prof. Levitsky has strong beliefs against meat eaters and milk-drinkers (as a milk-drinker, I didn&#39;t like this).He is a very fun and entertaining teacher.  He seems to really care about the subject and about his students.  The class involves more science then i expected and a lot of memorization, but i think i learned a lot.  He is very helpful and is a fair grader.  Overall it was a solid experience.My favorite class this semester by far.  He makes his lectures very interesting, the time really flies.  I have learned SO much from this class.  Tests are straightforward for the most part, which is nice.  Take NS 115--you won&#39;t be disappointed!!A professor that constantly uses weird terms to descibe the digestive system. He is not ashamed to use the work F**K or S**t constantly in lecture. Does weird stuff at times like taking off his trousers and running around in lecture hall. Interesting profcool dudeWeird guy, and a class that should be much easier than it turns out to be. not recommended.He&#39;s a really cool guy.  His lectures are interesting, but the tests are sort of tough.Very entertaining.  However, think while he&#39;s &#34;preaching,&#34; because he likes to insert his own opinions and propaganda. Tests are okay.  The paper isn&#39;t bad either.  Overall, good class if you feel like listening to someone who seems like a &#34;Fast Food Nation&#34; lover.  However, the class didn&#39;t help me learn to eat properly because of the propaganda.Nice prof, nice class. Tends to &#34;preach&#34; a lot though.  NS 116 is a &#34;help course&#34; that helps you do well on the essays.  prelims aren&#39;t difficult, just excrutiatingly long (100 t\/f questions).  you don&#39;t really need to go to class, since he puts up all the lectures (including the audio) online.  all of the prelim questions come from the lectureGreat teacher.  People say he says propaganda which is not true.  He tells you what the facts are and lets you decide. He doesn&#39;t tell you not to drink milk he just says not to drink a lot of it. He doesn&#39;t say not to eat meat just not eat a lot of it. Everything is in moderation and after listening to his lectures it has changed my diet for life!Levitsky is a great teacher.  He prepares special lectures every once in a while, and you really have to appreciate how much effort he puts into whatever he does.  I managed to talk to him on the sidewalk as he was walking out of class, and he&#39;s a nice guy no matter how you look at it!No CommentsHe&#39;s a pretty cool guy, kinda nuts. He tries to make the subject more interesting. If you take NS116 they take you through the big paper step by step...No CommentsLevitsky is incredibly immature. His lewd jokes are not funny. He constantly refers to the digestive system as &#34;the holy sanctimony&#34; instead of &#34;the holy sanctuary.&#34; If you can look past his personality, he is a decent lecturer.This is by far the best class I have ever taken.  Yes it&#39;s difficult, but if you take NS116 you should do very well. He&#39;s hilarious and very passionate about what he does. Don&#39;t buy the book though...Absolutely loved the class, and I&#39;m not even a nutrition major.  After taking this class, I&#39;m considering a switch though.  Very charismatic professor who does his own research and provides his own conclusions rather than merely lecturing on what the book says.  That was what I was hoping to find at Cornell, not just another book lesson.To do well, don&#39;t use the textbook, just memorize every word of every lecture (get takenote!!). He frequently misspells and misspeaks, but this course is prolly one of the best I will take at Cornell because of the bredth &amp; depth of info taught. 116 makes the paper a non-problem.energetic but crude and cockyThe material is useful and interesting, the professor is extremely humorous and it&#39;s very easy to pay attention, but the tests are annoying (T\/F = not fun), and the term paper can be a problem if your TA is unecessarily strict. Still, it&#39;s a class that I would recommend that everyone experience.for a science prof he really doesnt know what he is talking about. Slides having to do with any real biology is usually wrong. He says a lot of crazy things and some of them are just wrong. overall, easy class to do above the mean in. if buy take note there&#39;s no need to go to classHe is hilarious and all of his lectures are fun.  I learned so much in this class and would recommend to anyone even slightly interested in NutritionLevitsky is the ONLY professor I&#39;ve ever had at Cornell that truly wants to get to know his students - he is very approachable and he even offers coffee hours for chit-chat on Wednesdays.  He&#39;s just GREAT! Oh, and an excellent teacher, to boot.ooooooooh yeah. when in doubt (on the exams), the vegetarian habit--&gt; good, animal product --&gt; bad. he tries to cover alot for an intro class. just do urself a favor. buy takenotes &amp; memorize every detail.Easy A","difficulty":2.4042553191,"rating":3.914893617},{"index":4062,"prof_name":"David Levitsky","prof_dept":"Health Science","class_name":"NS1150","comment":"Worst class I&#39;ve taken at Cornell. He disagrees with the textbook and doesn&#39;t point it out to you. Presents material like a TV show, tricking you into thinking it&#39;s a BS class.prelim scores depend on an ability to read through ambiguous T\/F questions. He has an insolent sidekick, the course administrator Joy. Dealing with her is anything but joyfulTests are true\/false very fair and overall Levitsky is a great professorLevitsky is an excellent professor! He wants every student to succeed in his class and offers a bunch of extra credit opportunities. I highly recommend this course! It is a lot of material but is easy to do well in if you study.Levitsky is a great professor. Very passionate about nutrition and using it to change the world. Great intro to the major, but also good as an extraneous class. Drawback: much of the research he presents is his own, so take everything he says with a grain of salt.Even though he posted all of his lectures on the Blackbaord site, I still attended. He gives interesting lectures and is very passionate about the material that he presents. The exams are very straightforward; if you know the material, then you will do very well.Levitsky is definitely my favorite professor at Cornell so far. All of the lectures are recorded so you don&#39;t have to go to class. Prelims (2) are about 120 questions (mainly true\/false and some matching). Final is cumulative. You definitely have to study hard and be able to memorize a lot of info to do well in the class but Levitsky is awesome! :)Professor is funny and the material is interesting. However, a lot of memorization and regurgitation is required. The wording on test questions are sometimes unclear. Take advantage of the various extra credit opportunities that are offered. Take NS 1160 if you can because it will provide sample questions and guidance for the term paper.Dr. Levitsky is passionate and informed, also very nice. His lectures are interesting (cooking in class, etc.). Every test is TF and has an opportunity to argue points back afterwards. The work load is very low and the paper is very easy if you take NS1160. Just listen in class and you&#39;ll be fine. No textbook to buy. Lots of easy extra credit.Hands down the best class I have ever taken at Cornell!! Take it and you wont regret it!!HES THE BEST As a lecturer, he&#39;s fantastic! However, I thought the class was WAY too difficult  for a 1000-level (especially since I&#39;m an HD major and only took this as an elective). The lectures are awesome and hilarious, but the exams were pretty hard for an intro class. You also have to do a pretty extensive term paper at the end, too.Prof. Levitsky is GREAT. His lectures are funny and informative. He offers rebuttal opportunities after exams, and genuinely wants you to learn and care about your health as it relates to nutrition. Also, the TAs are incredibly helpful and always accessible. I am in ILR, and am so happy I chose this class as my science &amp; technology distribution.A solid instructor, however, he is strikingly narrow-minded for a class that requires a particularly unbiased focus. He regularly comments on how to approach nutrition issues from multiple viewpoints and then neglects to do so himself. Also, the class itself is very lazily constructed and arranged. It&#39;s easy doeNS 1150 definitely isn&#39;t a BS science-requirement course. There is a ton of information covered in the powerpoints, and you will have to study hard. Levitsky, however, is the man and a talented teacher.Extremely genuine, fair guy. He really loves nutrition and cares about the students. His class is entertaining (usually) but tests are hard and you basically teach yourselfAwesome class and professor! Really easy and fun, highly recommended.Great professor. The tests are hard and require lots of studying but it is hard to think of a more practical class at Cornell.Probably my favorite class at Cornell. His lectures are exciting and actually engaging.  A lot of people complain about the true\/false tests but I like them.. you do actually have to know the material because a lot of them are very specific.. and if you don&#39;t know you have a 50% chance of getting it rightLevitsky is absolutely hilarious! His raps and songs are the best. I&#39;ve learned a lot from his class. Mostly note-taking and studying on your own. You can get help if you need it. Very entertaining!!The class is fun and the information is not difficult. Does require some work (especially the paper) but a lot of help is available from TAs. Lectures are taped so attendance isn&#39;t necessary but tests are based on them almost entirely. The book isn&#39;t used at all and not worth the money. I never opened mine and still had an A- in the class.Very enthusiastic he makes the class interesting and funVerry biased, his research is way too controlled and lacks validity, focuses too much on environment, too much emphasis on feelings and placebo (I guess that&#39;s what psychologists do), course too simplified, loves disproving health claims with no support, why in the world is a psych prof teaching NS? just as dumb as the students are.Ummm... I don&#39;t know who the people are that said this course was hard...  That&#39;s nonsense.   If you honestly thought this course was difficult,  you don&#39;t belong at Cornell.  The course was something I was expected to excel in during freshman  year--of high school.  Honestly, guys, how do you not get an A??  The course was way to dumbed down.I took this class because I was interested in nutrition, and I wasn&#39;t disappointed. Dr L is an excellent lecturer, he&#39;s never boring and he likes to swear. The tests are definitely fair, but not easy. Do not buy the book, you don&#39;t need it. If you&#39;re interested in human biology, not plants and animals, take this course.Very passionate. Interesting class. Presented in an entertaining way. However, the tests are really overkill... very very long and only T\/F which I find is a poor rep of what students really know about material... T\/F tests reading comprehension. I enjoyed his class, but also felt extremely mislead most of the time (hard, and NOT a 100 level class)Loved the class. The lectures were extremely interesting and Levitsky supports all of his &#34;evidence&#34; with material from his own studies or his colleagues. A great way to begin taking interest in the nutrition field.Dr. Levitsky is a nutty professor. He does a good job of making you laugh and making you grossed out, but in the midst of all this, students are misled into thinking this is a 100-level course. It&#39;s not. Prepare for the difficulty of a 200- or 300-level nutrition course, especially the term paper and your peer review of someone else&#39;s.Fun but HARD.Levitsky is charismatic, and at times really funny.  He&#39;s also really unorganized (his lectures hop all over the place and he loses papers all the time).  He does not always agree with current nutritional understanding.  His exams questions are really confusing and indirect, but he will insist otherwise.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I would not recommend him to anyone.Great teacher. Easy class if you pay attention during lectures and study your notes.Hard class for non-science people (like myself) but very interesting and practical. Gets better after the first prelim.By far my favorite professor. He is so funny and also an understanding professor. I looked forward to going to lecture. Sometimes they were exciting, but they could also be bland depending on the topic. Taking the supplemental class was also very helpful.Prof. Levitsky is not only an expert in his field in obesity and nutrition but also a passionate, hilarious professor. His lectures were inspiring. NS1150 material is not difficult but very comprehensive and you would need to know a great amount of details. Very time consuming but his lectures are hilarious.I never went to lectureLOTS OF MATERIAL!!!!!! Exams are super long and meticulous, so you really need to know your stuff. Levistky is an amazing professor, and knows how to make the material more interesting. Would recommend taking very detailed notes!! Do not take for an easy A, but otherwise a fascinating class.I loved this class and I learned a lot, but it was also one of the hardest classes I&#39;ve taken. I am not a science major or pre-med. I took this class for fun (do not recommend if you are looking for a low-key fun class) and had to take 5-8 pages of notes per lecture and study for 8-10 hours before each exam. Love the professor though!He is one of the worst prof I have ever met at Cornell. Unless you are a HBHS major which requires you take NS 1150, do not take his classes. It&#39;s awful.He is an understanding professor. I took the course for credit in the summer, so there is a lot of content. He explained the concepts in the lectures thoroughly with animations and graphs. Using a supplemental textbook is helpful. I would take this class again!His lecture videos sometimes contradict themselves and his speech often lacks cohesiveness that it makes the material unclear.Those complaining about him promoting disordered eating clearly don&#39;t spend time reading the relevant literature. As someone who DOES, and someone who is also on the Eboard of Body Positive Cornell, I can say that is falsity. Levitsky opens your eyes to a perspective few others in the field give. Exams are a bit tricky, so study thoroughly.Puts up all lectures online, very specific slides,  Tests are a little annoying since they consist of over 100 T\/F questions. Overall great class, I learned a lot.Yes, it is true that he is funny and engaging. It&#39;s unfortunate that his lectures are biased and promote unhealthy eating behaviors. He does not promote body positivity (or even body neutrality) and his class is known to lead many towards disordered eating. If you&#39;re going to take this class, be wary of his overlooked biases and manipulated data.One of my favorite classes at Cornell! The class is well organized and Levitsky is so  interesting!Material is interesting, but poorly explained. Lecture contradicts itself. Exams have &gt;10% mis-worded questions that are removed. Prior exams provided w\/ incorrect answers, yet unchanged. Answers for test changed w\/o notice. Prof thinks anecdotal is same as antidotal. Lectures excluded from Blackboard b\/c of errata, but used in exam.

Interesting content and lectures though, even though it&#39;s mostly guests. Make sure your group does well on final project!Professor Moseley was alright, but the grading on tests was pretty unfair in my experience. The grad TA grading was insanely rough and it was almost impossible to go straight to Dr. MoseleyArguably one of the kindest, fairest, and well intentioned professors at Cornell. NS 2600 is manageable and it is very possible to get an A. Work hard on the group project and follow the rubric and you&#39;ll do wellShe ain&#39;t itAlthough Jeanne is the professor, this class is taught more by guest lecturers. The content was okay but it only mainly covers HIV, maternal mortality &amp; water sanitation. It is also very unclear on what you&#39;re suppose to know for the tests\/pop quizzes. A lot of students just don&#39;t like the structure of this course at all. Would not recommendJeanne is an excellent teacher who really cares about her students. She is super approachable and always willing to help a student in need. The class has a few assignments, a prelim, a group project and a final, all of which are pretty easy to do well on. She gives an outline for the prelim and lets you use a &#39;cheat sheet&#39; for the final.Jeanne&#39;s energy and excitement for global health is contagious.  Most of the class is an array of guest lectures. But overall, Jeanne and her team do a wonderful job of presenting the class and I enjoyed every minute of it.one of the sweetest professors you&#39;ll meet at cornellnice professor, but class is mainly taught but a ton of guest lectures, do the work and you will get decent grade, I never read the readings or book and i manage to fully participate in lecture and breakout. beware of the group project grading is kinda tricky for that. a lot of the information is review if you are familiar with public healthThis class is super overrated. It wasn&#39;t terrible, but not something I would strongly recommend. Lots of guest lectures which vary in quality, writing assignments are annoying and the exams were weirdly difficult. Jeanne is really nice but the class just wasn&#39;t that great.It&#39;s hard to truly grade Jeanne as a lecturer because almost 60% of her lectures were outsourced to other people who knew a lot more than she did, (which isn&#39;t difficult.) She is a nice individual, but she treats this class more like than English class than the science class it is. The writing skills were worth more than the actual ideas in essays.","difficulty":2.4545454545,"rating":3.1818181818},{"index":4072,"prof_name":"Zhenglong Gu","prof_dept":"Science","class_name":"NS2750","comment":"Took this class with Dr. Gu in the Fall of 2013.

Doesn&#39;t accommodate students needs. But! It&#39;s easier than the other biochem classes and is more pre-med\/vet focused.Professor Qian definitely challenges you. If you want to do above average in his class you need to put in the work for it, but he&#39;s extremely helpful if you utilize his office hours. He wants to see you succeed and definitely believes in you.Took NS 3200 in Fall 14.  Did not like this class and would not recommend. Professor Qian taught 34 of the class and he was not very clear due to his accent.  Also, by cramming it all into one semester, you do not go very much in depth. Fell more like a Cell bio than biochemistry. Easier than 3310 but I would recommend  3310-3320 to learn the mostAvoid if possible. He is not easy to understand and his lectures are so lackluster.  Even though I found the material interesting, I only understood the slides by studying them on my own... basically, Khan Academy was my best friend taking this class.  He is terrible at answering questions.  His exams are manageable, but nonetheless difficult.Honestly, I felt like he went pretty fast through the slides during lectures, and he wasn&#39;t very helpful during office hours. Make sure you go to class because he will test you on things he says, but are not explicitly in the slides. He did throw in a few jokes though. Not the most understanding prof. The TAs will be your best friend.He is a demanding professor and covers a lot of very important content. That being said he does move fast and it is hard to keep up at certain times in the semester. I spent about 10-15 hours a week fully digesting the material and it was a course I will remember because it reminded me why I love biology. Would take it again in an instant.Good professor in general! But the material covered is more like cell biology and I am a bit disappointed by that... Would love to see more chemistry.He throws a lot of information at you at once so be ready to record his lectures. He also is hard to understand sometimes.

People need to stop finding things to complain about, I loved Dr. O&#39;Brien.Class is based entirely on memorizing what&#39;s written on her powerpoint slides, so there&#39;s no educational reason for attending class.

An okay course at best.Such a waste of time. Fahey&#39;s knowledge is rather limited. To quote a poem written about Titanic is a bit too extreme. If you put minimal effort, getting at least an A- should be really easy.Interesting lectures, though they were very biased.  Sections were absolutely useless.  An ironic requirement for the natural resources major, as it&#39;s so similar to other department courses that it&#39;s really only useful for non-majors.The first few lectures grabbed your attention, but after that, it was a spread out semester of different environmental issues, which in itself is boring.  Fahey does an alright job presenting, but he becomes a white noise after awhile.  The quizzes are easy one sentence answers, and you dont really have to pay attention to do well.Be careful with this class. It seems like an easy A but if you miss a couple of quizes andget a bad TA to grade your papers (which is not the TA you have for section.. makes no sense) you could end up with a B.Bad &amp; boringThe lectures were really interesting, and you have to go because of the quizzes, but the paper grades are really dependent on your grading TA, who is not your section TA. Mine was horrible and never contacted me when I tried to talk to her about the papers which were graded ridiculously.Class rocks. Take.He&#39;s a little eccentric, but it&#39;s good clean fun. Quizzes not as difficult as they&#39;re made to seem. Protip: half the class leaves early after quizzes, so do yourself a favor and explain your answer. Gripe: TA paper grading scheme. Few good grades.

Yavitt is so enthusiastic and makes science easy to understand. Funniest person and very understanding. If you need any help, he is willing to stay after class or meet. Easiest class I&#39;ve taken at CornellFun professor who is able to convey information well without getting too serious.  Take this class and you&#39;ll see everything from stripping to the Simpson&#39;s to chainsaws!I really enjoyed Yavitt&#39;s class... his humor and enthusiasm keep the lectures pretty interesting, and the class overall is really easy. Prof Yavitt&#39;s an awesome guy, he&#39;s willing to get to know you outside of class and very willing to help you get research experience.Prof Yavitt is a very funny and easy-going guy that really tries to make his class fun. Since there are no tests the lectures don&#39;t seem very necessary\/relevant, but make sure you go and pay attention for the quizzes! He is willing to get to know you outside of class, and personality-wise is one of my favorite professors at Cornell :-)This guy is the man- super funny and energetic. Four decent length research papers give the class a guise of difficulty but the overall approach to grading is that if you show up and try you do fine. Pop quizzes once a week kind of require to go to class every time, but lectures aren&#39;t bad.Hands down one of the best professors I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Prof. Yavitt is an extremely nice, passionate guy who genuinely cares about teaching. There are only 3 papers, 7-10 pages, and two easy outside assignments. There is also section, but it isn&#39;t difficult. Also there are easy pop quizzes once a week. Can&#39;t say enough good things Prof. Yavitt.Great professor WILDLY funnyWonderful professor. The rare combination of extremely intelligent, an excellent instructor, and passionate about the material. I strongly recommend him.pop quizzes 1 time a week, you can play the system so that you do not have to attend every classJoe is hilarious, down to earth and truly cares about the material.  I loved his class and would be more than willing to take another with him.  This class was a great way to fulfill the science distribution requirement.My favorite professor in all of college. Fantastic lecturer. Always learn something that goes beyond the classroom. Papers are stressful because they&#39;re so much of your grade, so broad, and so large.

In lecture, he does NOT use powerpoints and simply just talks at the class, goes on random rants and reads quotes from books. Outside reading is VERY heavy. Despite telling you to &#34;skim,&#34; he expects you to know tiny details on the essay final exam and take-home midterm. AVOID!!!Enjoyable, great depth of knowledgeThe most hysterical man. Had him for summer college and we still act like best friends.Worst professor I have ever had the misfortune of having at Cornell. His &#34;lectures&#34; (I use that term very loosely) are very disorganized and consist of him basically rambling random quotes. Course reading is HEAVY, easily over 100 pgs\/wk for most of the semester. Take-home midterm (avg 25-30pgs), term paper, nightmare in-class final. Stay away!Unquestionably, Tantillo is a great speaker and an interesting person. Sadly, his teaching skills are extremely lacking, and his expectations greatly outweigh the quality of his lectures and efforts (his TA grades everything!). The readings he assigns are difficult to keep up with, assigning a 400 page book for two weeks. I would not this class!!I started this class pretty nervous because of Professor Tantillo&#39;s reputation of giving a lot of readings and grading so few assignments.

I did really poorly on the mid-term, by Cooch prodded, cajoled, and helped me learn the material, and get an A. He is so anti-typical prof as to be unreal.Ever wonder what it would be like to take a class with someone who doesn&#39;t care what anyone thinks, so long as you learn? Evan is that kind of teacher. Cornell must hate him, but thats good for us.Best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell. Best class. Evan is a master at explaining things. Has a good sense of humor also.This guy wants you to succeed and can tell who doesn&#39;t show up to class. He can seem very intimidating but he is incredibly understanding and is open to helping you out in office hours. Honestly the best professor I took that semester and I went back to take more classes with him.Class is ok. I don&#39;t see when in my life I will use anything I learned in this class. Just took it because it is mandatory. Evan is a nice guy once you get to know him and he&#39;s a fair grader.Great class - I&#39;m not a &#39;math person&#39;, but Evan is pretty much a master at explaining fairly complex stuff in very accessible language (he should teach a class to the math profs here on how to do it). Even manages to be pretty funny (most of the time), which given the subject is no small feat. About the only class this term I never wanted to miss.I only took this class because it was required, but I&#39;m so glad I did. Evan is unlike any other prof (in fact, you might have trouble believing he&#39;s a professor at a snooty Ivy League school). Does the best job of explaining abstract ideas of any prof I&#39;ve ever had. And he&#39;s pretty damned funny in the process.Best professor I&#39;ve ever had at Cornell. None of the ivy league bs. Appears to be very tough and intimidates you in the first class, but is actually a very caring and passionate prof. Office hours very helpful. He sends you all the lecture notes, very detailed and thorough.The best. I took 3100 first, and then about everything else Cooch teaches. Now that I&#39;ve been in grad school for a while (ok, more than a while) I realize how criticall Cooch&#39;s classes were in getting me here. In fact, I still use his notes, which are clearer than the stuff I look at in my &#39;grad classes&#39;.Best. Prof. Ever. Took a subject that is abstract and a bit &#39;dry&#39;, and turned it into my favorite class so far at Cornell. He actually likes teaching!Very nice and entertaining. Class is not very useful - you can just read through his crystal clear lecture notes. Exams can be somewhat challenging because he gives you problems that you&#39;ve never seen before so you have to really by able to apply what you&#39;ve learned. BUT gives unlimited time on the exams and is very generous with partial credit.Cooch is by far my favorite professor at Cornell. Take any class you can get with him, work hard, and you won&#39;t regret it!Scared me to death at first. Basically flunked the midterm, but he never stopped encouraging me, and helped whenever I asked. Ended up with a B. Evan is great.Thought I&#39;d hate this class (took it to satisfy a quant requirement), but turned out to be the best class I had that term. Evan is amazing. I bombed the mid-term, but with his help (and the army of TA&#39;s he has), pulled it up to a decent A-. If you ever want to see someone teach because they want to, not because they have to, take Evan&#39;s class.Thought I would hate this class, but turned out to be the best class I&#39;ve taken in a while. I suspect real &#39;math geeks&#39; will hate Evan&#39;s approach, but for me (hated calc), he was a savior.

Some projects weren&#39;t clear in what was being asked for\/evaluated, but that may have been addressed since I took the course. Participation goes a long way.I think this area is not really a science. Prof makes it look like a science but subject is not scientifically based. Not based on sound data or even data analysis. It seems the class encourages a socialist mindset which reflects the inner ideas of the professor.Dr. Kassam is very wise and knowledgeable. Pushes his students to their fullest potential and gives great and specific feedback on the essays, as a grad student. He makes the lectures very personal and intimate, and deeply connects the information to spiritual wisdom. I would have given 4.5 because lectures often are rambly and anecdotal.Eye-opener Dr. Kassam opened my eyes about indigenous communities all around the world. He has strong opinions, but it is because he is very knowledgeable and have done research all over the world Canada, Europe, and the most remote places in Central Asia--countries that you don&#39;t even know how to pronounce. Easy A if you go to class and ask Qs.This guy is something else. He&#39;s one of the few professor&#39;s who can be described as wise. His mellifluous words make it impossible to lose your concentration. Take any class of his if you want to become well rounded individual.Confusing class.  Canadian professor who seems to teach this class to promote over - regulation of environment policies similar to Canada. May be he desperately needs to work in United States to promote this flawed concept.  He has a good sense of humor - may be good class for entertainment. Great professor! And great class. One of my favorite classes at Cornell.Confusing class taught by a Canadian professor who is disgruntled with US policies. Reminds me of Ted Cruz: Hey prof, if you are not happy with US policies, go back to Canada.  Follows his own confusing book.Some good and some bad. Easy class, be prepared to participate in discussion. Dr. Kassam is not a bad lecturer, but many of his conclusions are based on anecdotes and opinion. Overall came off as poetically pretentious, but a lot of students seemed to think that he was wise. Easy A if you show up.Dr. Kassam is one of the best professors you could ever have the honor of taking a class from at Cornell. He is incredibly invested in his students. As long as you try, and prove that you have an interest in the subject matter (no matter if you agree with his ideals or not) he will respect you and support you.

Nevertheless, you MUST take this course before you leave cornell. I am graduating this year and I have not had a better professor than him.This is by far, one of the best classes you could take at Cornell and Bruce is absolutely fantastic. In such a simple way he introduces concepts of the ocean and then transforms the class into an unsettling yet awing awareness of the greatest threat to HUMANITY: climate change.

Small mistakes will lose you a lot of points on homework and exams.The professor goes off on tangents during lectures a lot and is condescending and doesn&#39;t answer questions on Piazza when asked about a simple topic.

His problem is in his demeanor. He looks down upon you and treats you like dirt.I think Prof. Callister is one of the best professor I had at Cornell.

Exams are similar to and a bit easier than the homeworks.  Come to lecture, you&#39;ll succeed.Very easy class, but you won&#39;t end up learning too much. His exams are just like the homework assignments. Callister is a very entertaining professor but he is full of himself and difficult to approach outside of class.Awful. Gave garbage feedback during office hours and only taught topics during lecture in ways that were convoluted and didn&#39;t agree with standard practices, meaning that if you self-studied you were screwed.

Grading criteria was very clear and  fair, since he readily made changes to it after looking at the overall performance on exams.

C&#39;mon, Cal-man, push the class back to like 12:00 and I&#39;d actually be able to make it to class.It was so interesting to take ORIE 350 class. It was very good chance for me to learn about the accounting. Prof.Callister was sooo helpful during semester, and encourages me in studying acconting.Callister is great.  His class is early, but that&#39;s really the worst thing about it.  Sections can be a bit boring too.  But Prof. Call. is funny, and his lectures are clear. He makes it easy to do well in the class, and exams are ALWAYS fair, no tricks at all. His anecdotes scattered throughout lecture are hilarious, and def. help keep me awake.if you thought or 310 was hard you are a giant idiotHe may give easy exams, but he&#39;s still one very dedicated prof. Really helps students understand the material, especially during office hours. Makes the extra effort to email students with important material and information. Lectures are interesting too.He teaches in a way that makes me enjoy this really dry course more and more.  He puts in a lot of effort into the things that he is teaching.  I really enjoy this course.  Thank you Professor.  You indeed deserve all the stars that you get.  I will intro more people to take this course heh ...Accounting is horribly, horribly boring, but it would be that way if it was taught by circus clowns and kung fu masters. Callister&#39;s clear, witty and has the best handwriting I&#39;ve ever seen in my life. This is a pretty good course.I think anyone that dislikes Professor Callister or his classes either have no sense of humor or were deprived of joy as a child. He is great. He tells is like it is and makes even boring subject interesting\/relevant.  One of the best professors Ive had at Cornell. Honest, fair, helpful, understanding and sarcastic what more do you needThere is no other professor that I would rather have for an 8:40 am class.  Great sense of humor.  Do the work and get an A.Callister is a funny guy.  Good sarcastic sense of humor.  He made accounting my favorite subject this semester.  Take this class, you&#39;ll be glad you did.Callister is the best teacher at Cornell hands down.  If you go to class and make any effort you will get an A or an A+.  His sarcastic humor is hilarious, and where else will you find a professor that has Anna Kournikova on his laptop background.Callister is hot.  And he loves hockey.  And his children.  And we love him for that.4 credit class, i managed to get a good grade without stressing too much.  kisses to callister!No CommentsCallister is the man. He&#39;s smart, funny, and knowledgable about the material. Very good lecturer.

CANT STRESS ENOUGH-READ LECTURE NOTESIt is because of Resnick that I started hating Cornell. The fact that they can let someone so inhumane and someone who does not care at all about students teach a class at Cornell makes me completely lose faith in the teaching standards of an ivy league school. The worst teacher I have had in my life.Horrible handwriting during lectures and could not understand him very well so it was hand to decipher, never answered piazza, did not post solutions to practice problems. Did not seem to care for students . Overall, super poorly run class. Curved to a B during COVID while ORIE 3300 curved to an A-.Good professor, very smart. Cares about students. Most importantly, explains things super clear and always willing to answer students&#39; questions(he asks if anyone has questions many times during lectures). I usually don&#39;t write comments, but I would recommend take statsII with him.Doesn&#39;t give solutions to practice tests, homeworks are much harder than the examples presented in lecture, and he mostly just reads off of the slides. Doesn&#39;t provide much help and doesn&#39;t answer questions about course logistics on Piazza. I would not recommend taking a course with him. Very unsympathetic during a global pandemic.He is unsympathetic. I did badly on first exam and I went to personally meet with him. He simply didn&#39;t care and didn&#39;t want to help me. Was very rude. Do not recommend taking any class with him.I usually don&#39;t write reviews, but Professor Samorodnitsky is amazing. It&#39;s a privilege to have him. Always asks if people have questions during lectures. Homeworks are very educational. I also surprisingly have a blast taking his exams, even if I&#39;m not sure on a question.   Very likable guy. Would love to take another course with him.Overall a very good and *FRIENDLY* professor. My one gripe is that the exams had only 4 questions each, and I feel like I got a lower grade than my level of understanding should have gotten me because I slipped up on one question on one exam.Chill guy, FAIR tests, and very helpful with questions. much better than some of the other ORIE professors. Stats 2 could have been much worse!The best ORIE professor I had at Cornell.  Very willing to help students and gives clear explanations.Awesome guy.Not an easy class, but the professor is very friendly, helpful, and caring.Samorodnitsky can be a little difficult to understand at first,  but once you get used to his thick accent, he&#39;s pretty darn good. He&#39;s the best professor I have had in ORIE thus far. His explanations are very clear and concise and he is very willing to help his students. He&#39;s also an awesome advisor -- he cares for his students.Jamol is an engaging professor who expects an honest effort from every student. He is very intelligent, but is patient with students who take longer to understand difficult concepts.

I scored pretty poorly on the tests, but still was able to make a decent grade in the class because he grades the course very generously.He is a nice guy but he glazes over most concepts. I really did not benefit much from going to his lectures and often had to return to the material in the textbook to reteach myself the basic concepts. Nice guy just not effective as an instructor in my opinion.He&#39;s great! One of the nicest professors around.No CommentsGreat prof, decent class, really nice guy and genuinely cares about his students and the class.","difficulty":2.8421052632,"rating":3.6842105263},{"index":4220,"prof_name":"Tom Evans","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"PAM2000","comment":"Really enjoyed Evans lectures. Study for the tests by reviewing the homeworks closely. A lot of people say that his office hours are confusing. Always clear where you stand compared to others due to his clear grading criteria with distributions for every homework and prelim. Appreciated his organization skills.Cawley is a class act...all the way. By far the most interesting teacher in PAM. Lectures were pretty interesting and presented very clearly. He has a &#34;song of the day&#34; play when you walk in (attempts to tie it to day&#39;s topic..sometimes weak). His videos are awesome, those always have some solid connection to econ. ONE BAD THING: Electronic exams.I had higher expectations for this class. From what people had previously posted I thought it would be a lot more enjoyable. Did well in the end and for the most part enjoyed Cawley, but it wasn&#39;t a great a class as I thought it would be. I wasn&#39;t in PAM so I took this as an elective.Awesome professor, very knowledgeable!! relatively easy class and interesting materialGreat Prof. Lectures were extremely interesting to attend. Not an easy prof though. Tests aim to see how well well you apply what you learned, not just knowledge vomit. Graded pretty fairly, and curved fairly too. I thought I was on the verge of B+ A- but got an A? This class is not easy but not too hard either.Evans is a good professor. He teaches everything in a clear manner, and incorporates useful real world examples. The only problem with him is that he drinks the free market limited government no taxes juice too much. His views are  short sighted and I don&#39;t think he thinks critically enough. Might just be a problem with economists in general thoughAn interesting class. Applies a lot of models and learning to the real world. The professor is clear in his explanations- homework follows what is taught in class, but is surprisingly tougher. It&#39;s probably the most challenging part of the class, but if you can do the homework then the prelims are very manageable.Took PAM 2000 in Spring 2014. I really liked him as a professor. He definitely will present his biases on things, but loved how we opened every class with discussion. He wrote fair exams and homework and genuinely care about students.  One of the best professors I have had here. I would recommend any course that he teaches. Ok, Tom knows how to teach an Intermediate Micro class. For a subject that I thought I wasn&#39;t very interested in, he managed to be extremely engaging and clear in every lecture. He starts each class in the morning by playing music and then tells a news story related to a concept we are learning about that day. Not an easy class, but enjoyable.go to class and do your homework and you will be fineProf. Kim was good, but he occasionally went off on tangents where he would cover the chalkboard with equations and graphs and no one could follow his train of thought. Even though it&#39;s not a prereq, basic calc knowledge would be helpful in this course. Kim tried to explain the calc parts but didn&#39;t do a great job of it. Course median was a B+.He was okay, sometimes his lectures were a bit hard to follow and he would include a lot of irrelevant information in them. Tests were slightly difficult but reasonable for the most part. His TA was not helpful and discussions were a huge waste of time.He glazes over most concepts, I often had to return to the material in the textbook to reteach myself. The exams are inconsistent in their format and the homework assigned was varying in its helpfulness. It was his first time teaching the class, but his lectures did not help me understand the material. Sometimes funny thoughProfessor Kim is really nice and reasonable. His tests reflect the homework. If you go to class and do your homework, you&#39;ll do fine on the exams.Evans had interesting lectures and generated discussion, but never clearly told us what we needed to know. He graded HW for accuracy but when he went over answers in class after, he often concluded that even he didn&#39;t know the right answer. Overall, interesting lectures but poor structureSUCH A GREAT TEACHER AND CLASSVery smart teacher. Lectures are relatively interesting, and the class material isn&#39;t very hard. The tests are fair, and don&#39;t involve difficult math problems like you might find in econ 313. You can do well by just studying the home works and lecture slides.Best teacher I have had at Cornell so far. Very clear, very knowledgeable, and very fair.  Overall great guy.Evans is so wonderful. His class is so interesting, he is so smart, an so excited to share his thoguhts with the class. He makes great class discussions and is the best teacher I&#39;ve had yet at Cornell.CLEARLY THE BEST PROFESSOR AT CORNELL. I was lucky enough to have him twice in my college career, and I wish I could have taken more of his classes. He is CRYSTAL CLEAR and very knowledgeable. He knows how to teach. After taking his economics classes, I decided to minor in economics because I loved them so much.Whoever wrote the comment below is in bed with this guy. He&#39;s not clear at all when he teaches and at 100mph. No one knows what&#39;s happening because he lectures WHILE writing so if you copy the notes you&#39;re screwed and if you just listen you&#39;re also screwed. He also asks a lot of annoying questions on his tests that don&#39;t really test your knowledgeYeah, the person who said Evans is the &#34;best&#34; is obviously lying because Cornell doesn&#39;t offer Economics as a minor. He&#39;s not clear at all, spends 20 minutes every class trying to impose his political views instead of teaching the material. Don&#39;t take econ with him, you&#39;ll be screwed and unprepared for harder econ courses.","difficulty":2.8636363636,"rating":3.8636363636},{"index":4221,"prof_name":"Rick Geddes","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"PAM200PAM340","comment":"Very devoted to his class and very approachable.

Sassler has no idea how to effectively teach. She is unable to answer any student questions and rambles on endlessly. There are five tedious, confusing exercises (essentially essays) that are graded both harshly and subjectively. TAs are rude and unhelpful and form a cult of condescension around her.Easy curriculum, but homework&#39;s are graded unreasonably. She doesn&#39;t help you out if you are struggling.This class has very dry subject matter and is extremely boring. Lichter is clearly very smart but just really know how to translate his knowledge to a class. The curriculum is disjointed.The tests are hard in that you&#39;re just not really sure what you&#39;re supposed to know for the test. He did curve the first prelim. my 76 equaled an AProfessor Lichter is awesome! At times the subject matter is a little dry, but sometimes the subject matter is also very interesting. If you study the lectures before the tests, you&#39;ll do very well. He puts a nice curve on the midterm and final, and 30% of your grade is off of homework assignments that you can get 100% on :)Professor Lichter is great! He is hilarious and always willing to help his students. His tests are a little tricky, but you can do well if you do all the homeworks and study his powerpoint lectures before the prelims. I loved his class!Professor Lichter is a really nice guy and genuinely wants you to do well. The topics are pretty interesting. There is a lot of reading. Tests were multiple choice but the averages were pretty low (he curves). The class median ended up being a B. Oh my god this was the most painful lecture I&#39;ve sat through in my three years of college. The exercises are graded unreasonably harshly and the class is graded just by exercises and the two exams. Sassler makes awkward jokes and laughs at herself all the time and it&#39;s just irritating. Unless you have to take this class for PAM, avoid it.If 20+ people show up to a lecture every day just to click in and then leave immediately, something is wrong. Sassler is the worst prof I&#39;ve had in the PAM department, and if this class had been my first exposure to the major I probably would have switched out of it. Painful, useless class that was torture to sit through twice a week.Widely held as the worst professor in the PAM department. Class is dreadful. She totally picks favorites, which affects your grade. Her name tells part of the story because she is quite &#34;sassy,&#34; as in rude. The grading of her assignments makes no sense, yet the assignments will be graded harshly. Good luck figuring out how not to lose points.Professor Sassler was very clearly overwhelmed by the number of students she had. It was too much for her and she couldn&#39;t handle it, or be an effective educator or grader. She should teach smaller classes or stick to research.Passionate about demography and makes it legitimately interesting in her lectures. Prelims were in-class and easy if you can remember terms easily. Out-of-class projects\/assignments were interesting and honestly fun. For the questions that I did have for assignments she was helpful.This is the first time I&#39;ve ever rated a professor below 4 stars. AVOID. Being a good student won&#39;t save you. The professor will deduct points from your write-ups based on metrics that are NOT in the assignment instructions- and will not provide clear reasons as to why. The TA&#39;s aren&#39;t helpful, and are very rude and condescending.Among the worst classes I have taken at Cornell. She does not answer students questions well, rambles continuously, the five exercises are grades so harshly and very weirdly, very unhelpful feedback, no rubric given for exercises. If it is not a requirement for anything, do not take it!!!!Didnt hate this class as much as others did. There is only one midterm and one final and the final threw everyone for a loop because it was much harder than the midterm. For the papers, you MUST go to office hours. Expectations arent clear and TAs will take off points for stuff the prof expected, but wasnt made clear in the packet of directions.Class is graded completely based on Sharon&#39;s feelings. Yes, I got an A+ but I practically had to sell my left kidney to her to avoid getting literal Cs, which would happen if you didn&#39;t harass her and go to every office hour she heldProfessor Sassler looks like a really nice professional from the beginning, however as soon as you get your first assignment back your opinion changes. Be ready to die with her assignments, because her&#39;s or TA&#39;s comments do not help at all. They instead make you feel worser than you felt before.Pathetic excuse of a class. Rambling lectures are padded by incoherent jokes from Sassler and her crew of TA&#39;s who you&#39;ll grow to hate. Grading is all but incomprehensible with little to no guidance given before and after the assignment. The comments from TA&#39;s seem more like they are trying to get you to drop.","difficulty":3.7058823529,"rating":2.0},{"index":4223,"prof_name":"Don Kenkel","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"PAM204","comment":"TAKE THIS CLASS WITH ANYONE BUT HIM.","difficulty":4,"rating":1},{"index":4224,"prof_name":"Brandon Tripp","prof_dept":"Economics","class_name":"PAM2040","comment":"I wish his class was in a better location because his lectures were great!

The course has a lot of TA office hours. This course is mandatory and only provided to PAM students. Should take it in freshman yrProfessor Hall is a really reasonable professor. As long as you do your homework and attend lectures, you will do fine because tests reflect exactly what you learn. Tests are also open notes, so you can make study guides and bring them. Also, his lectures are super clear and easy to follow. Would take his classes again.Great guy, very clear lectures. The course is well designed, HWs are reasonable and intended to help you understand the concepts. Office hour every day is very convenient. Lectures are organized and exams are reasonable. I agree he is very forgivingHall was a really good professor! His lectures were easy to follow and he did a great job breaking down concepts so that students could understand them. Obviously very passionate about his work and wants students to succeed. The Stata component of the class was a little confusing, I wish we could have covered it in lecture as well as in discussion.I really enjoyed this class.

I&#39;m not a &#34;math person&#34; and I was dreading this class, but I ended up enjoying it! Hall does a great job of showing the step-by-step processes for each equation and his slides are easy to reference for the psets.

Excellent lecturer and actually takes an interest in her students...maybe too much interest.  Her method of picking TA&#39;s is a mystery.  Some are blatantly incompetent.  Must be something going on behind closed doors.Professor Avery is the best professor I have had at Cornell, and this is the most incredible class\/experience I have had here as well.  She learns the name every student in the class and cares about how everyone does. Lectures are interesting and the class is just completely satisfying.Professor Avery was really interesting and her tests were long, but curved pretty high. It was a lot of work for a PAM class, but that&#39;s not saying too much.

This class is a LOT of work. I feel like I did learn a lot, but because of the fast pace of the class, I don&#39;t think I have retained much. If you want to learn about policy (and turn cynical), I recommend taking.Professor Avery is super knowledgeable in her field and really cares about her students. That said, this is a work heavy class, much more than a normal entry-level class. The TAs are great, but don&#39;t expect to do well if you don&#39;t show up to class and especially do the readings, as they definitely appear on the tests. Super informative professor.Her class was a lot of work. The individual and group papers required way too much time and effort for an introductory level class. Had to study a decent amount for the exams but they are similar compared to previous years which made things easier. Required class for PAM majors. Avoid if your are not PAM major because it is too time consuming.Professor Avery is approachable and knowledgable! The class is a lot of work, but manageable. Prelims are memorization and she does look for specific wording in the answers. Lectures are interesting and make you think. She tests readings heavily and they&#39;ve been cut down, so take notes while you read! GPP groups are hit or miss. TAs are amazing!She loves what she does, is a strong lecturer, and obviously cares about her students. The course itself has a LOT of information (most of it in lecture) but as long as you go to class and pay attention\/take notes, you&#39;ll be fine for the tests. Grading is also fair\/easy.i took this class after reading all the comments here but honestly i don&#39;t really think this class is as big of a deal as some on this site has said. it was good, but not the best class ever. the professor talks very fast and very broadly about many topics so you don&#39;t feel like you learned that much. TAs bascially show films in sections.There is a difference between hard &amp; unfair. Avery&#39;s class is hard- intense, but rewarding. Prelims and papers require devoted studying but concepts are crucial for future coursework. She provides multiple office hours and extra credit. She cares so much for her class and students- she memorizes every students&#39; name. 2300 affirmed why I chose PAM.Very good prof. She gets to know each student&#39;s name, which is quite impressive. She also holds plenty of office hours and picks outstanding TAs who are knowledgeable in the field. I&#39;m not a PAM major (or anything close to it), but I found the class very informative and a good portrayal of what an ivy league course. Do the readings and go to class!Study the powerpoints. They are the majority of what&#39;s graded. The readings are too intensive...you can get by if you only do some of them. Short policy paper is hardest assignment of the year. All group projects are automatic A&#39;s. Avery is a very nice teacher and is very clear! Love that accent! TA&#39;s are great too.Prof Avery is fantastic! She really cares about her students and is a good lecturer. Her course does involve a lot of studying and essay writing, but it is 4 credits and most people end up with an A or B. TAs are very involved, the class is interesting and focuses on current events, and is overall a great intro to the PAM major.Prof. Avery is an outstanding professor. She really shows interest in her students. Even made it a point to remember everyone&#39;s name. Be sure to keep up w\/ the readings to the best of your ability and go over slides for exams. She is always willing to help if needed. A very interesting class and she has amazing TAs.Her lectures are pretty fast-paced. Her powerpoints are quite dense, but she flies through them. Fortunately, she does upload all of her powerpoints online. Very helpful, but the material is quite difficult and heavy.gpa is based on socializing skills. tons of hw.All of the comments below are true.The prelims for PAM 2300 or pure memorization and the class is simply a ton of work. Prelims combined with the policy papers take up an enormous amount of time.Professor Avery goes too fast through the slides, doesn&#39;t leave time for questions, gives Herculean projects, the tests are memorization of material you&#39;ll never use again or could look up easily, and the TA&#39;s form a cult of personality around her. Avoid this class if you can.This class was not fun. I am definitely switching majors next semester. I don&#39;t like the way this class is run, really encourages students to kiss up to her to try to be come a ta or research assistant. Feels more connection based than merit. Most of the content from lectures was useless. she made a point to take attendance after a break or projectThe GPP was the worst assignment I&#39;ve ever done, especially since a member of my 3-person group did nothing. Prof. Avery should have mid-semester group evals to weed out free riders. Lectures were dry and hard to follow, prelims were absurdly difficult and she took off points for not mentioning things that were not asked as part of the question.Hated this class. Interesting material, but her teaching was terrible. Obscene amount of work outside the actual class. Not accommodating &amp; expects u to prioritize her class over others. Narrow-minded in that she can&#39;t see how less-privileged ppl might b affected by policies. 2 other PAM majors I know switched out of the entire major b\/c of her.The actual material for this class isn&#39;t particularly difficult, but the way that it is presented in lecture is confusing and hard to follow. The group project took up a ridiculous amount of my time (easily 80+ hours over the course of 2 months) and the prelims were hard- average raw score was a D for both of them, but they&#39;re scaled to a B.Useless readings. Killer prelims, b\/c there&#39;s so much material &amp; b\/c the way she words questions makes it hard to know what she wants. No final, but a group project. Thinks her class is the most important &amp; schedules mandatory events over ur other classes. Hardest class I&#39;ve taken in two years. Lectures are 60+ slides long &amp; convoluted. Great TAs.Best class I&#39;ve taken so far at Cornell. Material was interesting and Prof. Avery was engaging. Prelims\/final were tough to study for (lots of memorization) but if you put in the work and studied a few days in advance they were fine. TAs are incredibly helpful. Do the extra credit. I think class average was around A-\/B+ range.This class has so much potential but Prof Avery makes it the worst course at Cornell. Her slides are poorly executed--each powerpoint is between 60 and 70 slides, lacks structure, full of text, and she flies through them. Her class is scattered with no focus, and there is endless useless and over-tested dense reading (lack focus\/meaningfulness)Not as great a class as everyone says. A huge tease: seemed interesting at beginning of semester but got more and more boring. Avery is a nice person and good communicator, but has way too much text on her powerpoints and isn?t all that engaging. You?ll do fine though. Papers aren?t too bad and tests are lecture-based with huge curves. No final!She&#39;s nice, but her class is the worst I&#39;ve ever taken. Material isn&#39;t difficult at all, but there&#39;s an obscene amount of memorization. Prelims are killerher questions are poorly worded &amp; ambiguous and you get points off for not phrasing things exactly how she wants, and for not including things she didn&#39;t even ask for. 0\/10 wouldn&#39;t recommend.I always got the sense Prof. Avery was talking down to us  while it is a freshman-heavy course, it isn&#39;t the first exposure to college work for a lot of us. Her lectures contain a lot of material. The group paper was absolutely awful and allowed for a ton of free riding, which was ironic since she taught about the negatives of that in lectures.","difficulty":3.8076923077,"rating":2.9230769231},{"index":4232,"prof_name":"Rosemary Avery","prof_dept":"Political Science","class_name":"PAM230323","comment":"Avery makes you work, maybe harder than you&#39;ve ever worked, and her anal retentive attention to detail might buckle the weak at heart.

He can get side-tracked sometimes, but everything he says always ends up relating back to the material. The exams are almost entirely based off the slides, which is good because the slides are well-organized. He knows what he&#39;s talking about and takes time to answer individual questions despite the huge class.Took in the Fall of 2013. He is absolutely fantastic, delivers lecture material in a very clear manner and really wants to get to know students!  The prelims could be a little tricky but overall not too hard of a class. Definitely recommend because this class was one of my favorite classes at Cornell!Most people would say this class was &#34;easy,&#34; but, for me, I didn&#39;t do so well on the exams. You learn A LOT about the U.S. healthcare system overall and little things no one ever knows. Prof. Nicholson shows HILARIOUS videos in class and he is a good lecturer. Would I recommend this class: UM, YES!Nicholson is the best professor I have ever had. He truly cares about the students and is a brilliant economist. The class is fairly easy, with only three fairly straightforward assignments and three prelims that are very fair in grading. I looked forward to going to class--he makes the dry material very interesting.Very interesting lectures, unbiased analyses of current events. Easy homework assignments and tests, however TA grading of these can fall short sometimes but Professor Nicholson is very reasonable if you take the time to talk to him.Biggest lecture I&#39;ve ever taken at Cornell, yet Nicholson still made every class engaging, relevant, and interesting. Powerpoints posted online contain all the necessary information, but I went to class anyway because he was that good of a lecturer. Stay on top of lectures and memorize everything for the tests (including graphs) and you&#39;ll get an AOne of the BEST lecturers I have ever met at Cornell. The content is super interesting and understandable. Tests are open-book and mainly based on lecture slides. Sean is great at explaining things so don&#39;t worry if you are confused about anything anytime. Course design is related to current events and very inspirational. 100% recommend!Very respected and very good lecturer. Disperses fun yet very relevant videos in his lectures that keep them interesting. But he also basically reads off his slides, and he posts them online, so no need to go. Tests are fairly hard, but the class is curved crazily nicely, so not difficult at all. The 3 assignments are easy 100s as well.One of the best classes I&#39;ve taken at Cornell. Professor Nicholson is not only an excellent, engaging lecturer, but he&#39;s also just an amazing person. He was extremely accommodating during Covid\/online learning, and made sure we all had the resources the succeed in the class. Assignments were easy and prelims were primarily memorization-based.Prof. Nicholson is a really great guy, very knowledgable, and a fantastic lecturer. The content he teaches is interesting for anyone interested in healthcare. I hear a lot of people say this is an easy class. Don&#39;t be fooled, exams can be tricky and the class is curved because of it. You will need to put in some work to do well.Everything you need to know are on the slides. The key to doing well in this class is 1) study objectives that he lists in every PPT 2) remember trends 3) memorize ratios. I think his prelims are getting trickier. I took another class of his, and they were straightforward. Questions more thought-provoking now. Write down what he wants to see.Such a good professor. Made us cinnamon rolls, includes funny clips during lecture that reinforce points but also are a break up the lectures really well, very understanding with deadlines and timing, willing to adapt the course to covid circumstances, so many good things to sayHe is the best prof I have ever met at Cornell. He is chill and gives really good lectures. He really understands his students. You will learn a lot from him seriously. He knows what he&#39;s doing.He is a great teacher! His lectures are engaging, and you can tell he is really passionate about the subject. The exams are fair, and the exams are based solely on lectures! The class isn&#39;t curved, but there are a couple extra credit opportunities. I would def take a class with him again. If you work hard and study, you&#39;ll get the grade u want.One of the best classes Ive taken so far. Exams are memorization heavy, but online it was open note which made them very easy and straightforward. Homework assignments were easy and took little time. Prof Nicholson is super caring and answered many questions despite a huge class. Also got us cinnamon rolls and brought his dogs to office hours!Professor Nicholson is a great lecturer.

The amount of work required for the papers and exams is, for lack of a better word, absurd. There were 3 papers, and two exams (prelim, final), and undoubtedly not worth 3 credits. The material is interesting, but she somehow lulls me to sleep every lectureOnly an easy A class if you actually put in the work that she expects, which is reasonable.

If not the hardest.  what makes this class rough is 1) PSETS: very, very long, from 10-25 hours, and 2) STATA (which you need for psets), 3) ridiculous exams that are way too crammed for the alotted time. Be prepared for those 3 things ruining this class.Miller is a little all-over-the-place, he speaks fast and jumps from topic to topic during lecture and it can be confusing. But he&#39;s a really good guy, went out of his way to add extra office hours at night and is always willing to meet and talk about the material. Psets take forever and there were too many, prelims were difficult but scaled.Probably one of the greatest professors ever. Great lectures, mad chill.

I dropped this class and readded when the class I dropped into was horrible, and it&#39;s been fine, definitely easy to get an A, but lectures aren&#39;t super stimulating and I haven&#39;t learned that much that was new (maybe this is just better taken as a frosh or soph). As a person? Aspirational. Amazing. Adorable.My favorite professor at Cornell so far! She is super inspiring and so kind. Is always there for help or just to chat.

He is very approachable and friendly, and I had no reservations about asking questions. The class was really easy too, and to get the most out of it one has to be self motivated to do the readings. His lectures often lacked discernible structure, but class was still very stimulating and a pleasure to attend.Derk encourages discussion but is also a great lecturer. He knows everything about metaphysics but is also really knowledgeable about related scientific theories. The more work you put into the class, the more you get out of it. Readings seem optional because Derk covers everything but DO IT ANYWAY.Derk is an awesome guy, and modern philosophy is relatively easy (I believe the median grade is around A-). The readings can be a little difficult (esp Kant). Also the final\/midterm is awesome because he gives out the questions beforehand. TAs can be hit or miss (watch out for birch). Main complaint is lecture is unnecessary.This man is one of the greatest professors at this university. He is such a smart individual but isn&#39;t arrogant or hard to approach. He runs the course very smoothly and fairly: two essays and two exams, but he gives you study questions for the exams and holds reviews for the exams. The only negative would be getting a bad TA to grade your essay.He knows the material very well and does a great job of keeping lectures interesting. He&#39;s less involved in the papers (unless you go to get help from him, in which case he&#39;ll be extremely helpful), but he gives you a list of test questions before each test, so there&#39;s no reason to do poorly. Definitely recommend.Professor Pereboom made what I thought would be a really dull class engaging and thought-provoking - he really cares about all the students and class discussing, which makes you actually want to go to lectures. Great class!Prof. Pereboom is great! He has a great insight in the topics, which he teaches with great clarity and precision. If you want to learn about Modern Philosophy, this is the class to take.","difficulty":2.2222222222,"rating":4.8888888889},{"index":4336,"prof_name":"Michelle Kosch","prof_dept":"Philosophy","class_name":"PHIL2240","comment":"M.

He has a bad rep with other profs too.  His grading is not understandable (he doesn&#39;t give A&#39;s unless &#34;you know the material as well as [he] does.&#34; AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.completely unapproachable.  makes you feel like an idiot for asking a question.  grading seems very subjective.  avoid him.  other profs teach this classNot a fun classProfessor Hodes is amazing. He&#39;s one of my favorite professors so far. If you&#39;re interested in the material and you are willing to put in the time, he&#39;ll be there for you. He is one of the professors that I am asking to write a recommendation for me.Professor Hodes is a nice guy who wants to help his students.  However, unless you are exceptionally good at things like math and logic, it is impossible to get an A.  I am very hardworking and have never had a grade below A, but in this class, despite working 10-20 hours\/week, the best grade I got was a B.  He moves at his own pace, not students.Most people dislike the class, not him. He is an excellent teacher who happens to enjoy a very difficult field. He loves what he does and makes for an interesting, if not useful course.Prelim 1: Spent 30 min on one problem that was actually unsolvable because Hodes made a mistake writing it.  And, for my efforts in noting that on my test, I got an extra &#34;+&#34; next to my grade.  Meaning I got a &#34;D-+&#34;, i.e. a D- with a gold star next to it.  Really makes me feel much better about having to drop this and take 20 credits next semester.On both one prelim and our final, he gave literally impossible questions. He announced that he messed up the prelim after the test, and realized his mistake in the last 10 mins of the final. Despite this, he didn&#39;t offer any type of compensation for the time people wasted trying to solve his impossible questions. Overall, a very unreasonable guy.He&#39;s really not that bad. Absent-minded and yes he did assign impossible problems on the prelim and final. But his presentation in class is decent and the textbook is excellent. Exams are fair, he doesn&#39;t ask things you haven&#39;t learned. Make sure you check your prelim grades though -- he messed up mine 2 times. Do all the homework, best way 2 learnHe&#39;s not as bad as everyone says.  Still, he is a bit dull.Absolutely Intolerable.\n Avoid. Avoid. Avoid.An excellent Professor for students who accept, even though they are &#34;Ivy League&#34;, that they are often wrong and unaware that they are wrong.  Many people like him even though they are not doing well grade-wise.  Often these are people who don&#39;t do the homework.  This material isn&#39;t difficult if you do the homework.  Do it!  Hodes rules.As interesting a teacher as you are in the material. Those that found him boring found the material boring, while I thought both were pretty interesting. No question he wants you to do well, makes himself available outside of class, and gave us last year&#39;s tests to study by. I&#39;d take his advanced calss next year. The text book he chose was great.Cool class, terrible professor. Good Prof--but grades unfairly.Oh man, this was the worst class in the world.

Homeworks are super easy, and exams follow the exact same format as the practice ones. The only thing that might lower your grade is participation if you choose to skip lectures and recitation, but it won&#39;t hurt you that much.Don&#39;t take previous comments too seriously. Hodes is good at the subject and he is suuuuuper cute!!! You won&#39;t see many old nice guys around the campus. The course is hard though and worth taking only if you like to analyze boring sentences. Homeworks are hard compared with prelims and finals.  Lectures were a little on the dull side, but you can tell Hodes loves logic. The proofs were interesting and homework was very simple. Exams were reasonable and based entirely on proofs done in class.One of my favorite professors at Cornell. I have taken two classes with him so far. Brilliant and extremely clear. A logician indeed. Not to mention he is the most chilled professor I&#39;ve had when it comes to deadlines. I don&#39;t know why most ratings are negative about him. Maybe if they took one of his smaller classes, they&#39;d appreciate him more.Hodes is a brilliant man, but is tragically condescending. He&#39;ll openly bash you in class for having faulty reasoning or poor grasp of the English language. The subject material is focused more on fundamentals, so it&#39;s a bit different from normal logic classes.

He&#39;s approachable and he does care about his students. This is an auto tutorial class and it&#39;s not easy so you have to work your butt off if you want to do well (especially if you have little to no Physics background). The unit tests were annoying but doable. Insane level of HW. One week&#39;s work  2 labs and 2-3 demos (20 pages). A unit test and practice unit test. Must read 2 chp per week (to learn material) with about 3 practice problems per section - about 50 problems per week total. On top, lots more optional work to do. I personally struggled with the course- even with all of the OH - hard topic.Hes the professor now for autotutorial physics. Take this class. He&#39;s good at explaining things and a very smart man. Course is time consuming but easy grade.Very rarely did the lectures help clarify the information at all. Most of it is formula derivation, which is all outlined in the textbook. The only reason I kept going to class was to watch his demonstrations go horribly wrong. He did have a love for Physics, and was so was a bit inspiring that way, but he never really explained things.The readings are concise and helpful. If you read what your supposed to, do every single problem you&#39;re assigned, and are good at algebra, you&#39;ll do very well. Doing practice problems till you get it is the key to this class. There&#39;s also always help available if you&#39;re struggling with something.Took the auto-tutorial physics I and II. Overall this course is really dependent on how much effort you put into it. Prof Giambattista was approachable and helpful at explaining concepts when you seek him out so don&#39;t be afraid to ask for help. Not a course for those who expect prof to hold your hand.

Nice, Passionate, and there to help in anyway that she can.  Lectures involved a lot of demonstrations, so if you&#39;re a visual or conceptual learner that&#39;s really helpful.  TAs were generally good, and discussions were really helpful.  Prelims were not too hard.  Homework was super tough, so definitely consider office hours or a study group for that.  Labs were a waste of time.Although Thom-Levy is a high-level physicist at CERN, she wasn&#39;t able to explain the basic concepts of Physics clearly.Her lectures weren&#39;t extremely helpful. She was not able to make the course material interesting. She did demos,,, but they weren&#39;t very effective at all. I think she does really try to make things more interesting, but it&#39;s just not working! I went to the lectures only to find out where we were and studied the materials with the textbook.The demos were not helpful.  She was most helpful in lecture but not always clear.  The homework was graded, which was the worst part of the class.  The fact that you could spend hours doing the homework but get a check which only counted for a 2\/3 for 10% of your grade was dumb.Damn good teacher. Very friendly and so approachable! He is also very caring\/helpful, and very committed to his jobA lot of examples and demonstrations in lectures, medium sized homework every week. Labs aren&#39;t bad, especially compared to Chem 2090 labs. Julia is very sweet and funny and always willing to help.Dennis is the best ever!  He is always willing to help you, and he explains very clearly.  If you don&#39;t understand still, he has a great amount of patience.  He definitely knows his physics and is the friendliest person I know.So much homework. Exams slightly harder than homeworks. Lectures not particularly interesting but mandatory due to iClicker questions.Grade weighed heavily on prelims and final exam (25+25+15 --&gt; 65%) Lab session twice per week, assignment once per week. Generous on general marking of works, just submit the things on time and you&#39;d be fineTaught my discussion section Fall 2020 (online). He is a wonderful man and helps us so much. He grades fairly, consistently, and quickly.iClicker questions count towards participation credit and there are several per lecture so attendance is virtually mandatory. He speaks sort of slowly and not very concisely, and has an accent, but is not difficult to understand. Somewhat charming in his awkwardness. Dont be like me. Go to class and do your homework; the grade isnt hard to get.Enjoys himself a lot during lecture.He&#39;s very energetic and makes really boring physics entertaining. The class is still boring and a ton of work, but his lectures are okay.Physics 1112 is a lot of work, but exams are incredibly fair and do not have any surprises. Hope you get a solid TA who can clarify topics during discussion as that&#39;s where I did most of my learning.Bert is a southern gentleman that tickles your brain with his smooth southern drawl and most definitely Juuls during classUseless class, learned nothing, quizzes are so poorly written he has to give free points just to make up for it.An ok professor. Explains things well and has interesting demonstrations which help students to understand concepts. Also, sometimes tells interesting stories or has weird comments.Thorne&#39;s lectures are always interesting and are worth going to. He&#39;s a nice guy who makes the lectures amusing and efficient. His tests are rather difficult but if you study enough you&#39;ll be fine.Bert is always trying to make the material more interesting through the lectures and seems to really care about the students! However, sometimes things get confusing. HW sets are unnecessarily difficult and the tests intentionally confuse youHis demos are the best demos ever... He is really clumsy and that definitely helps keeping you awake and interested during lectureDr. Fulbright is very caring and always willing to help. But it&#39;s a flipped classroom so lectures are mostly iClicker questions. Not the best lectures and reading the textbook is absolutely essential beforehand. Problem sets are quite difficult so office hours are extremely vital. Prelims are highly conceptual and have a lot of multiple choice.He was my physics professor and also my section TA, and he wasn&#39;t a spectacular teacher but by far above average and his passion for the subject really showed through, he does good demonstrations and his examples are very useful.Can&#39;t really say much about the professor, but the class was a well implemented flipped classroom. Lectures involved solving practice problems and some demos that helped students understand them. Homeworks were sometimes challenging, but helped me teach various physics concepts. Prelims were reasonable, unlike the ones in CHEM 2090.I&#39;m the kind of person who needs to see rigerous proofs of everything, so as a result I read the textbook a bunch. However, that being said lectures were always engaging with frequent demos. Prof Leclair was approachable and always helpful, and put in the effort to get to know many of his students.Leclair is a boss.  He was actually a really cool guy and made my love physics.  Lecture is really awesome GO TO LECTURE!  The demonstrations def help you visually see the concepts.  Now the problems sets are harder than the stuff done in class and I did struggle but there r so many resources to help you so you&#39;ll be okay! got a B- minimal effortTruly inspirational professor. He&#39;s solved the Riemann Hypothesis after all, who knew it was just a matter of taking a familiar first order approximation? I feel strongly toward this great, great man. Take his class. It taught me how to think, effectively, algorithmically, computationally.Avoid at all costs.Prof. Fulbright cares so much about his students and surely loves the material he is teaching. He has so much passion, and his infamous demos show this. He is a great professor, and although the course itself is a decent bit of work, the material is not the most difficult.

Roughly 70% of the exams are multiple choice, which sucks because there&#39;s no partial credit for most of the test questions.

Admittedly, if you do not have a really, really good basic physics background, he does not go into enough depth for you to learn physics.  The homeworks and tests can be really challenging; however, if you go to his office hours, he will walk you through everything.  He&#39;s a great guy to learn from.He likes math very much.  Too much time in lecture was spent deriving physics equations rather than teaching us the concepts.This class is really hard. Go to every section you can. He is a pretty boring lecturer, and fairly tough. Approachable most of the time for help.Can&#39;t really explains his stuff, and his lecture jumps around - or maybe it&#39;s just that I&#39;m not smart enough.

The class isn&#39;t easy, so don&#39;t expect free marks.This class is awesome.  Elser basically starts each lecture with 1+1=2, and by the end builds up to some ridiculously complicated concept -- but you understand it somehow.

He&#39;s funny and gives so many interesting examples in class.this professor was one of the most intelligent professors I&#39;ve known at Cornell.. enjoyed attending his lectures and his exams covered the material very well.Thorne is really nice and cares about students doing well.  He&#39;s funny and does a good job of using real life examples in his lectures.  Overall a great class.Amazing class!  His random comments and jokes make the class interesting.  Especially the ones about Canada.  In the beginning of the semester, I would spend a full day on those horrible P-sets.  But the amount of work in any physics class pushes stress-borders everywhere.  I&#39;m glad he was my prof for this class.Prof. Thorne is the greatest man alive!! He is definetly one of my favorite professors at Cornell. He makes such funny jokes during lecture and is so passionate about physics. I hated physics before, but loved it because of him.GREATEST PROF AT CORNELL. Didn&#39;t even know I liked physics! Relates everything simply and understandably to real life. Genuinely cares about how his students do. VERY helpful. Offers extra information, tours of the nanotech Research facility, etc. Great guy and he looks like Kevin Spacey! May sound like it meets a lot but it&#39;s worth it. Workload okThis was a dreadfully hard class for anyone who doesn&#39;t love physics, but the prof did a good job with examples and good lectures, and made the subject ok.  Tests were very hard, but Thorne was always willing to help out.I really love Thorne, clearly a genius and *enjoys* teaching and talking to students. He tells good physics stories during lecture including the physics of the kennedy assasination. Premeds: he uses a lot of medicine examples. Class is very time consuming (15 hr\/wk minimum) Choose a prof for recitation\/lab TA and your experince will be much better.Liepe&#39;s lectures are interesting and very clear.  He&#39;s obviously excited about the material, which makes attending class less painful.  Problem sets suck but make sure you know the stuff for the weekly quizzes.  Exams are harder than practice tests or problem sets.Fantastic Prof - very helpful, funny, great lecturer.  He takes a fairly basic physics course and really pushes so that students learn to apply simply physics in many real life situations.  The course itself is only alright, but Prof Thorne is just great.Thorne is hands down one of the BEST professors I&#39;ve encountered. Really interesting lectures. Makes really funny jokes without meaning to. LOVES to teach and interact with students. He really cares, and that&#39;s rare. Tests are challenging, but not impossible. Homework is long, but graded on effort. Weekly quizzes are annoying.Kyle Shen is an amazing professor!!  He puts so much of himself into helping his students because he really cares and wants us to learn.  He explains things very clearly, thereby helping us actually make sense of physics in the real world.  Highly recommended.  :)I hated physics until I took this class. Prof made lecture interesting and clear with demonstrations.  He is really nice and wants to help his students do well.  Really organized and the class has a very generous curve.  Prelims are fair, the first is the hardest. Section was helpful; go to it because they factor attendance into the grading curve.He was so helpful!  I had him as my TA and he was the best!No CommentsThey make the course as doable as possible... Lots of busy work, but forces you to stay on top of materials... Liepe is extremely clear during lecture- be sure to go. Labs are stupid and annoying, but often last less than an hourFast lecture speed, but thorough. Reading the textbook, or at least skimming preps your mind. Do the Problem Sets, and go to TA OHs when stuck. Prelims are tricky, at least the first one as you are not ready for what to expect. Lab=annoying, not lined up with lecture material: many times doing lab work and learning the material a week later.He just transfers notes from his notebook, to the screen, and usually goes too fast to be able to follow, so lecture is really pointless and he makes it boring. Read the textbook, make it make sense for you, but you have to go for the clicker. First prelim was not what anyone expected. Way harder than the PSets &amp; Co-ops.No CommentsKyle Shen was an awesome professor. He was a very enthusiastic teacher and eager to help. His quizzes were sometimes hard and tricky, but they helped us learn the material for the prelims. He really went beyond the call of duty in making extra handouts and example problems. Plus, Kyle is a genius and a rock star too!This guy was amazing. Not only did he make lecture easy to understand, but he also made it interesting! Also, he is one of the nicest guys here at Cornell-very helpful!This is pretty much the nicest prof you&#39;ll find who is also willing to help you.

He is the most helpful professor I ever had.  His lectures are extremely clear and he is always ready to answer my questions.  Unlike many other professors, he makes nearly no conceptual errors.  Bert rocks!!!Not a great professor.  His lectures are dull and he makes no effort to engage the students.  There are few examples of practical applications of the subject.  The tests and homework demand quantitative answers, while in lecture, he NEVER works example problems.  The students have little interest in learning what he teaches.  Bad class.Fulbright is one of the worst lecturers ever!  His lectures are so dull and simplistic, his jokes are stupid, and he expects everyone to understand the physics at a higher level than he teaches (and he doesn&#39;t teach at that level because he probably can&#39;t).  He copies the obvious equations from the textbook for his lectures.professor fulbright is someone who really cares about his students and explains the concepts very well. his lectures might not be fun, but was helpful and well-organized. aboveall, there&#39;s none like him when it comes to being a nice, accessible professor. i&#39;d be honored to take another class of his.I have to say that for a science professor, he&#39;s one of the best I&#39;ve had. He&#39;s extremely clear. The course is very well organized. His demos are interesting. All around a good class. The only thing is that he&#39;s not too exciting, but he&#39;s the punniest man I&#39;ve ever seen. No one can compare. But please laugh when he puns. It makes him smile.Bert is a nice guy, but not a good lecturer.  He bored everyone in Physics 208.  It is hard to stay awake in that class.  The homework assignments are tough and the lectures usually don&#39;t help you in solving the homework problems...try reading the book for help.Clear lectures. Very thorough. I heard that Phys 208 is harder than 207, but for me it was more enjoyable and interesting (and easier). Do the Problem Sets, as weekly quizzes in section are based on them.

Tests are way harder than hw and are all based on theory- never had to do any calculations.  This class was a huge struggle, but probably still better than auto-tutorial.  Unless you need it for premed or a major, avoid it!His lectures are helpful and very detailed in what was a pretty difficult class.

However, he&#39;s a great lecturer who can explain anything professionally and concisely. His taste in clothing is also excellent and stylish.Hw, lec, prelims are fine.   Sometimes quite funny.   He seems to be nice.   However, for some reasons, the final is much harder than the prelims.No CommentsFun lectures-  we had at least one demo every class, and some of them were pretty neat.  But though his lectures are clear, be prepared to learn most of what you&#39;re going to learn in section.His lectures aren&#39;t helpful. I learn more in section than I do in lecture. He never does actual examples, only goes over concepts. His demos and experiments never work. I don&#39;t like him and his method of teaching.He does look like Willy Wonka, but he&#39;s a great guy. Really is concise and cracks some jokes too. Has also nearly killed himself several times doing demos, which you have to admire.Totally crazy. I came away from lectures having no idea what was going on. Admitted that he doesn&#39;t really understand electricity, even though he&#39;s teaching electricity and magnetism. Likes to brag about going to MIT undergrad.He is terrible Great guy. Very clear, often hilarious, always straightforward. His demos really helped (as opposed to the 5 labs this class had). Prelims were basically the same as the homework, sometimes even easier. The final was hard though, which killed my grade.Lots of demos, sometimes they work. Lectures are interesting and introduce topics well, but the only way to learn physics is to sit down and do problems, lecture isn&#39;t enough. Prelims are VERY similar to practice exams and are straight forward.Hard to focus in class, also difficult to keep up with the homeworks because they are never collected. Difficult course, but doableGibbons is boring. He genuinely cares about the students- he wants you to be involved. You can tell, because he tries to involve the class through voting, discussing, and &#34;warm-up&#34; exercises. Problem is, it doesn&#39;t work. He can&#39;t teach himself out of a paper bag. He&#39;s boring, and that&#39;s incurable.I suggest reading the textbook closely, but skipping lecture altogether. Prelims and final were very detailed, and mostly focused on material not well-covered on the problem sets. Lecture was therefore useless, as he only outlined very basic concepts covered in the text. Also didn&#39;t give a complete formula sheet on exams, what was up with that?attention cornell administration: GET BETTER PHYSICS PROFS. phyiscs department hands down has the worst professors in the school. tests are harder than anything covered in hw or class. this joker doesnt even give all the formulas and expects you to derive them....Gibbons sucks at life. Worst professor I have ever had...boring, useless, oversimplified lectures. Hard, long, homework on topics we had to &#39;teach&#39; ourselves. Hard tests, especiallly the nearly impossible final! very unrepresentative of what we were supposedly taught. bad bad teacher.Yes, this class is painfully dull. Gibbons is very monotonic, and is not helpful when u go to talk to him. I suggest being nice to your TA, and go to the 013&#39;s... they&#39;re relatively fun, i learned all the material there, skipped lecture, and did well in the class.No CommentsIt&#39;s all true...all of it.\n \n Avoid him like the black death.Almost every professor I&#39;ve had has at least one redeeming quality. Unfortunately, this one has none.  He&#39;s boring, confusing, monotonous, and worst of all does not seem to care about his students.  He cares enough to assign large amounts of work, but not enough to explain concepts or give extra help when you ask.  Only passed thanks to awesome TAsHorrible. Puts you to sleep in a second. Would not recommend but isn&#39;t that bad if you don&#39;t have any other options.Worst professor ever.  Plauged by inexperience and stupidity, he tries to spread it to he students.  If you get this prof know that you&#39;re in for a semester of learning everything by yourself.  Our physics department SUCKS!This man does not know how to teach, which is a shame because I really looked forward to taking this course.  I&#39;m teaching myself the course at this point.One of the worst professors.  His sadistic sense of humor and complete disregard for the success of his students make this class a struggle.  Hard to approach, lectures are disorganized and difficult to understand.  Very arrogant.No CommentsVERY boring. I skipped lectures because I knew I would end up sleeping. He also curved everything to a C+. I recommend reading the textbook, learning from the TA, and attending those 0013 classes (led by a really cool prof).offensively bad professor.If you have trouble sleeping, go his class. You&#39;re sure to fall asleep given his high degree of boredom. I was better off reading the book instead of going to lecture. Makes tons of mistakes and won&#39;t like it if you ask quesitons.His lectures are a waste of time.  I learned everything from section.  A good lab TA will make labs a pain, but you will ultimately learn much more.probably the worst run class ive ever seen... it took him 3 weeks to get a demonstration right.  his online quizzes are ridiculous and only serve to make you hate him and life... and this is from someone who genuinely loves physics...No CommentsSections are useful, Lectures are completely useless.  Get a good TA.Disorganized, vague, lazy, horrendous sense of humor.  Does not teach.  Online quizzes fail to appropriately test knowledge.  Do whatever you can NOT to be in his class.Horrible physics prof.  Boring, unorganized, and hardly teaches.  Stopped going to his class 2\/3 of the way into the semester, should have stopped earlier.  Prelims are pretty easy, though, as they test a limited range of concepts.The TA&#39;s make his class understandable.  Thank your TA every day.SO BORING and cannot teach to save his life. Once he tried to do an example in class - emphasis on TRIED. SO BORING. Lecture was nap time.Might as well not wake up at 9 am to go to class, sleep in, and then just study on your own or in a group later.  Good suggestion, go to the physics 013 class, now that guy, although old, he can teach and is interestingbad, but not quite as bad as everybody says.He goes over really oversimplified stuff in lecture and the problem sets he gives are impossible, but the exams are very fair, and a lot easier than the homeworkHe came to lectures half-asleep and talked in a monotone with lots of um&#39;s and uh&#39;s. He didn&#39;t say a word that was not in the textbook, so I just stopped coming to class. The warm-ups questions were ridiculous and unscientific. He didn&#39;t even know the right time for the final.I have no idea why people love this guy, but he was not on my good professors list last semester.Avoid this professor: he&#39;s obnoxious and useless.  His online quizzes don&#39;t test the material--they test how well you can read his mind (for example, one question asked you to pick a random answer choice and he deducted points if you picked the wrong &#34;random&#34; choice).Hilarious guy (though he may not intend to be at times); pretty great at explaining things.Class is a waste of time. He outlines the book, without adding anything useful.  The tests and hw are both challenging, but barely any partial credit and no calculators-long division takes up more time than the actual work if you know the material.You can either go to lecture or sleep through it. I vote sleep through it. He has some interesting demos and he does some interesting derivations. The textbook sucks, but we don&#39;t cover anything outside of it. I got a B and I attended roughly a dozen classes.

Go to lecture, know the math, and do the homework, and you should get a decent grade in this class.Honestly not that bad. If you study the lecture material with the book material you can get it. Tye is nice too and wants to teach well in class even if he loves the math behind everything. Actually didn&#39;t put me to sleep. Phys 214 only hires really good TAs so that&#39;s a plus.Eeek.He only concentrates on the math in his lectures, and they&#39;re basically pointless.  He doesn&#39;t make the tests too difficult, though.Good teacher. The exams he created were the best: not too hard not too easy and comprehensive.He ASSUMES you know a lot, and it&#39;s all about maths...I took this class a while back and didn&#39;t do well on it (C+). But it&#39;s not an easy class, my TA wan&#39;t that good, and the class itself was competitive (std dev is like 5 points on prelims), so it&#39;s not his fault. He&#39;s clear and helpful, and I definitely should have gone more. GO TO LECTURES!!!This guy rules.  He enjoys what he&#39;s teaching immensely, and makes physics lectures interesting.  The subject is tough, but he&#39;s more than willing to help you if you need it.Prof Giambattista is really really good. He explains everything so clearly and so well, I can&#39;t imagine myself falling asleep in his class.Very good teacher, excellent explanations, made a tough class a little more bearablefantastic professor and course! problem sets can be a bit challenging, but they&#39;re well thought out and you really feel like you&#39;ve learned a lot when you&#39;re done with them.  most helpful professor i&#39;ve had at cornell.Best physics professor I&#39;ve had, but that&#39;s probably because honors physics profs aren&#39;t that great (Veit Elser, Pollack...). Really loves physics, and does a good job explaining the stuff. Exams are pretty tough, and homework is tough! (it goes step by step though, so you&#39;ll know what to do) Go to his lectures and do the homework!this was one of the harder classes i&#39;ve taken.  this guy really has a solid command on the subject and it able to communicate and teach very well.  i should have put more time into this class to get a better grade.  exams and homework are hard.Pretty much what everyone else said.  Very good teacher, knows how to explain things in a way that&#39;s easy to understand.  The class wasn&#39;t too hard in my opinion, but I think they curve the class to a pretty low mean grade, so you need to work pretty hard if you want an A.No CommentsGreat guy. This class was fairly rigorous and I heard some bad things about it from other professors. It required a decent amount of work, but Professor Giambattista was very helpful and explained it great. If you have a chance to take any class from him, I&#39;d do it. You&#39;ll learn the material and get a decent grade.His excitement is clear, but he should really drink less coffee before lecturing!!Yo... he is da man... notgreat teacher, he helped out a ton, was very informative and very helpful. best science professor ive had at cornell, take his class.A very, very good teacher. I took PHYS 214 with Prof. Bodenschatz, who was the exact opposite, but Prof. Giambattista&#39;s life-saving office hours played a key role in my passing the class.The material is hard but he derives a lot of equation people take as granted. His grading curve is very nice as well, but dont expect to have an easy time-phys 214 is hard period.great teacher, very nice, class is semi-difficult but prof. giambattista helped out a lot, was very understanding and overall a great courseGreat Teacher! I usually skip classes, so it doesn&#39;t mean much, but for the times I was in class, I understood what he was talking about even though I missed half the material before that class. It was also immensely enjoyable to see such an EXCITING smile on his face all the time.A really great prof -- knows the material and enjoys teaching\n \n Publishes notes online -- helpfulI was excited by the previous reviews on this site, but Thorne is not nearly as good at teaching this class. Too many derivations, not enough examples, always runs over class time. Not good at explaining. Problem sets take way too much time. Frustrating class, even if you go every day. Wish I could have taken it earlier with a better prof.Quality lectures. Exams are fair. And that time he dressed up as Morpheus from the Matrix...

She is insanely nice and helpful if you go to office hours.  She may rush through things during lecture, but if you go to office hours, she&#39;ll clarify any doubts you might have.  Highly Recommended.Fennie is a nice professor. He does have a tendency to get kinda lost in some of his proofs, but he does generally know what he&#39;s doing.Pollack was the worst.  The famed quote, &#34;Copper is a metal&#34; was the theme of the class.  If I got anything out of e&amp;m with Pollack, it was definitely &#34;Copper is a metal.&#34;Professor Fennie is a good guy, but I think there&#39;s a lot he could do to make the class better. He knows the theory well, but his lectures sometimes lack focus and direction. He tries to answer every question, but sometimes his answers are too abstract. And his tests are ridiculous compared to the Problem Sets.Well he is a crazy frenchmen who wears his clothing so that all of his chest hair pops out. He also get angry when oyu ask a stupid question or give and answer that is correct but not the one he wantedHARD HARD HARD class. Her prelims are very tricky but she is a fair person. Not very helpful out of class tho.This class is one of my favorites this semester. Davis is a really great lecturer, and he explains things really well. He is also great about answering questions during lecture. My only criticism is that he misses a lot of lectures, and the TA teaches in his place. The TA is no substitute.hm... not sure what the fuss is about!  I&#39;ve taken both Pollack&#39;s classes and found her a very interesting lecturer, who is genuinely excited by what she teaches.  Prelims are exactly where you expect them to be, and homework is manageable (atleast compare to 218!).  Has a bit of a love affair with the Purcell text, but then again who doesn&#39;t?a heck lot better than veit elser for god&#39;s sakeHis lectures are very well put and easy to follow compared to how hard it would have been if you study by yourself or only with the book. His lectures are very relevant to the problem sets and exams. Make sure you understand the derivation skills he used in the lecture, because if you can do them you can do well on the test too.she will repeat the obvious &#34;and remember class, iron is a metal&#34; and confuse you when she teaches the hard stuff. her tests are awful.He&#39;s a good professor.

Grading scheme is unclear, tests don&#39;t always reflect the content, &amp; lectures aren&#39;t helpful in any way. His strategy is to look at the slides he took from another teacher for the first time in class, which means he has no idea what he&#39;s doing and sometimes gets his own iClicker questions wrong.I took this class fall of 2020. It was his first time teaching, but it was supposed to be lecture based, but it was anything but this. We had weekly modules, including multiple videos and readings. We were going at a fast rate at almost 1.5-2 chapters of the book per week. It was so hard to keep up. The 1st prelim was easy, but the final was bad.Liepe is excited about what he does and really wants to teach. His demonstrations are great and he always makes himself available. He knew in my class he wasn&#39;t dealing with Physics majors, but did a great job of not making the class seem pointless.His lectures are relatively fast paced. The man&#39;s brilliant and he makes his lectures fun, but you&#39;ll find yourself just copying down stuff in class, so it&#39;s a bit hard to interpret the material as you go in lecture. But he is enthusiastic and very willing to help! Exams are pretty hard though.Honestly the most awful experience I&#39;ve had with a class at Cornell. He was extremely unaccommodating during the pandemic and barely listened to students who complained that the exams and grading schemes were completely unfair. They posted the (very low) final exam grades on Christmas morning with no explanation or grade distribution. Awful.Never take this class with him. He did not listen to students when we complained and instead blamed it on us. The TAs are also overworked as hell and in the beginning, they didn&#39;t even respond to our own concerns and questions. He seems passionate about his subject but tbh he killed any interest I had in physics.Would not take him ever again. The final exam was designed for you to fail and stress you out (why even study then??), class structure was just way too complicated and extra. Not receptive to student feedback, TAs even were frustrated. The class was asynchronous but at times felt like a whole full-time job. The subject wasn&#39;t terrible, but he was.This man made me fall in love with mechanical physics. His class was a joy to attend each morning at 9:05am. A bit of advice from someone who did well: if you can do the three star problems in the text book, you will destroy the exams.Liepe is a dedicated educator and seems like a genuinely kind person. The course is as difficult as an introductory course for non-physics majors ought to be: not hard to get an A if you&#39;re not a slacker. His tests and grading are as fair as any I&#39;ve encountered at Cornell. He&#39;s really a model professor--wish we had more like him.Liepe is enthusiastic about teaching. b\/c the class is not curved- it is scaled- the prelims are very fair. The hws are tough, but are graded on effort- most ppl really do try, even though in my opinion they are tougher than the tests. labs are super easy, esp. compared to chem! section co-ops are like the test questions so they are helpful.An amazing professor!

However, if you  find the subject interesting and want to truly understand the fundamental concepts then Arias is a spectacular professor.He spent all of lecture going over derivations provided in the book, and just made us do math heavy problem sets. I would recommend not taking the class with him.Great teacher. Sat next to him on a plane; interesting guy. You do actually have to listen\/ read, but overall, got me really excited about physics and I remember everything I learned from him. Definitely take his class if you actually want to learn.I liked the flipped format of the class but I found the homeworks to be unnecessarily difficult. The tests were difficult but nicely curved. The lecture videos and questions were informative, organized, and easy to complete. If you put in the time to understand everything and attend lecture as the course goes on, you can do well.Probably one of the most brilliant people I&#39;ve ever met. Lectures were indeed mathematical- but in the best way possible. Contrary to what some would say- his derivations go far beyond what&#39;s written in the book. He generates his own problem sets that are tailored to what you&#39;d expect to see on an exam. Phenomenal instructor for a phenomenal class.Does a pretty good job explaining derivations during lecture.  Pay attention to these as they are pretty close to what the problem sets and tests are like.  I do admit the class is very &#34;mathy&#34; although it&#39;s really not bad.  The problem sets are good at bringing up old material so that you are always practicing what you&#39;ve learnedAbsolutely brilliant. He focuses a lot on theory and mathematical calculations during lecture and doesn&#39;t really give much application and problem-solving, but he is very organized and extremely clear in his explanations. Would definitely take another course with him.One of my favorite professors at Cornell. His lectures are theoretical but he make tough topics extremely clear to understand with a lot of enthusiasm. He cares a lot about his students and truly wants  them to learn the material. Tests are slightly challenging but the homeworks prepare you well for exams.HORRIBLE! do not take a class with this professor. literally did not learn a thing. makes me fail every prelim because he does not teach us how to approach the difficult problems he presents.He records video lectures before class, and uses learning catalytic in lecture and sections. Videos are very clear and helpful. He&#39;s very enthusiastic about physics .Arias is very passionate, which makes lectures more enjoyable. Other than that the class is crap. The discussion section is not representative of the difficulty of prelims. The problem sets are WAY too hard and do not help you for the prelims. In my experience, you feel like you know your stuff and then the test rolls around and you don&#39;t.Bazarov didnt teach us anything, and his answers to our questions just made us more confused. Each class was spent in breakout rooms, working on problems with other students, which proved to be useless. Homework was extremely hard, way above the level of lecture videos. Also grade inflation (on some assignments, a 70% becomes 100%).Simply the greatestBest professor I&#39;ve had in my four semesters thus far. He&#39;s extremely helpful and genuinely wants everyone to succeed. He&#39;s also very passionate about the material and teaches is better than anyone else could. If you have a chance to take a class with him, don&#39;t pass it up.Clearest professor I&#39;ve ever had. Empathizes with what the student knows and doesn&#39;t on a intimate level. However, you&#39;ll have to do a lot of work for his class (if you want to do well, that is).Professor Arias is the best professor that I have had in my time at Cornell. He is kind, approachable, knowledgeable,  and an all-around great guy. When students voiced concerns, may it be with format or content, he listened and acted, at one point even starting to produce hour-long video lectures to help. He is amazing, and deserves high praise.Terrible professor, impossible to follow in lecture. Frustratingly useless to go to class.The tests are the same every year, basically, but the material is still hard if you&#39;ve never taken AP and if you don&#39;t keep up with lecture\/reading. I found it hard to follow lecture, but that&#39;s just me. i fell asleep a lot.Prof. Arias is a good teacher.  I learned a lot through his &#39;flipped classroom&#39; method of teaching.  I would highly recommend watching the video lectures at  a faster pace, as Arias speaks kind of slowly and pauses a lot.  You can take a 45 minute video lecture and turn it into a 12 minute lecture.  Major time saver. Definitely attend lecture.He&#39;s alright. He seems easygoing and knowledgeable. Homework was incredibly difficult but this subject overall is difficult for me. Exams are easier than the homeworks, so if you can do the homeworks, you&#39;re probably set (still study, though). I basically had something due every day (co-op, video lecture+notes+pce, problem set, lab).He kind of reminds me of a dad. He was very approachable and encouraging during office hours. I started off struggling, but he was always willing to accommodate my learning style. Some people liked the flipped classroom method, and things really started to click once we switched to videos.Physics E&amp;M was a lot of work and demanded a lot of time that I sadly did not always have. Prof. Arias is a really nice guy who genuinely cares about his students and is truly happy when the median grade on exams is high. Don&#39;t sweat the problem sets too much, as long as you understand the Co-Ops you&#39;ll be okay for exams.Arias really cares about the students. He gets very happy when people in class understand the topics in lecture, and if they don&#39;t, he does his best to clear things up. This course is very fast-paced, and Arias doesn&#39;t like to waste much time. The problem sets are incredibly challenging, but if you understand the COOPs you&#39;ll be fine on the prelimsHe really wanted to see us succeed and seemed genuinely happy when prelim scores were high.  Probably the most likable professor I&#39;ve had so far.He is a very understanding professor and very accessible, is willing to help you and accommodate as much as he can. Very good lecturer. Clearly cares about his students.Fulbright is pretty decent for a professor. However, his monotone voice may make you fall asleep. He always explains answers to iClicker questions and tries to crack a joke from time to time, which is a plus. His exams were slightly difficult, but if you understood the material to a decent extent, they weren&#39;t impossible at all. Overall, not bad.His class is really hard, but he is a great teacher. Very enthusiastic. He is much more interesting if you talk to him outside of class, he gets kind of nervous in lectures. He is soo attractive.Great professor, really makes lectures lucid. The homeworks are leagues more difficult than the lectures however, which can be frustrating. Also, lectures are carried out in a group fashion; students are assigned to random groups of 3-4 and take in-lecture quizzes together.Very good professor. For 2213, he does a great job in dealing with huge lectures and a huge amount of material. He makes lectures interesting. The only thing is the lecture material is hard to relate to the hw and discussion stuff. Get the textbook even if it is not required. It&#39;s hard to know what goes with what between the lec, dis, and hw.great classWonderful professor; however, he curved the class to a lower grade then normal, so that contributed to lower grades. Very clear and enthusiastic.The material was presented very clearly and lectures were well organized. He&#39;s very good at explaining the concepts behind the material. The homework can be difficult, but the TAs are extremely helpful. Tests are fair.Arias is a nice guy, but is not very accessible to get help from. The P-Sets were incredibly difficult, covering material not taught and requiring 5-12 hours a week in office hours. The TA&#39;s often weren&#39;t sure how to do the questions (citing them as being harder than some of their grad-level P-Sets). OHs were ALWAYS packed (50-80 kids at a time).Good teacher, only complaint is that the tests questions were asked in very obscure and confusing ways. Many of the tests were based on randomly plugging in formulas, without the need for much physics.Arias is an amazing professor. If you ever have to take 2213, make sure he is teaching. Arias is so caring about students performance, and he is genuinely a nice guy. This is a really difficult course, especially if you struggled in multivariable like I did. The problem sets are hard, but they prepare you well for the exams which are pretty fairTake him now - it will be a fun ride.Fulbright was a nice guy, that is for sure. His lectures were informative, but they were a bit of a bore, unfortunately. What&#39;s more is that that attendance was mandatory. Still, relative to LeClair&#39;s 1112 class, Fulbright&#39;s 2213 was pretty easy, though I&#39;m probably saying that because I switched in after a stint in 2217.For electromagnetism this semester, the lectures were not very helpful with regard to exams, feel free to skip them and read the textbook. The problem sets were excessively time consuming and calculus heavy. He&#39;s not that bad, but I recommend taking this course with another professor in the spring semester.This is a review for how he taught electromagnetism for engineers. He gave extremely difficult problems sets, but the prelims were fairly easy. His lecture is very easy and simple, on the conceptual side, but that will not help with the homework which all rely heavily on vector calculus. The lectures were not all that helpful for exams either.Professor Arias was one of the most passionate professors I have had at Cornell. Even though I despised physics, he somehow managed to make me enjoy the class.Professor Arias is a wonderful professor that really cares about his students. The problem sets and lecture videos\/pre-class exercises are a lot of work, but Professor Arias&#39; dedication to his job makes it very enjoyable and worth it!!Alan Giambattista is a really great lecturer.  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s his deep voice or what, but I could never fall asleep during his lectures.  Plus, the lectures are mostly working on problems anyway, so that is very engaging.I liked his flipped classroom: readings\/videos and practice problems before lecture and in-class lecture questions. He was a clear, organized lecturer though maybe a bit too slow. He and the TAs were very approachable and helpful. This class has a lot of assignments at once (psets, pre-lecture questions, etc) but it prepares you well for exams.I am not a huge fan of his flipped classroom way of teaching. I would prefer to learn in class and re-enforce at home rather than the other way around. He&#39;s a nice guy though. If you haven&#39;t taken Electricity and magnetism before it will be a pretty tough class.","difficulty":3.4666666667,"rating":4.1777777778},{"index":4438,"prof_name":"Robert Thorne","prof_dept":"Physics","class_name":"PHYS2214","comment":"Thorne&#39;s a nice enough guy and an OK professor. His notes are a little tough to read, and the class is certainly not an exciting one, but he gets it done. Though I should note that he did get strangely vindictive when it came to quantum at the end of the semester.assigns ridiculous homework for no reason, making the class much harder than it should be for an irrelevant class used to fill an eng requirement. Also, TAs 1000x smarter than he is, so don&#39;t ask him for help. Dont take the class if at all possible.Great teacher, but I mean, come on, why can&#39;t you just make us buy a book? This class would be so much easier if we had an actual book for the class to work with.Liepe made PHYS 2214 not only survivable but very interesting. As a MechE, it is a requirement, and my experience in the class made me actually consider doing AEP instead. All prelim studying can be done from lecture materials, and Liepe is a VERY fair grader on prelims. He is also just a nice guy, is approachable, and will always answer questionsGo to class and pay attention, review the posted lecture slides for the prelims and do the homework to practice the material and the class is easier than most I&#39;ve had. He speaks clearly, usually doesn&#39;t rush through the material, and uses lots of good experiments in class.While you would have to put up an effort in the class, it is relatively do-able provided you attend lectures and do all the homework. Sometimes he can be very direct, and when he&#39;s explaining stuff he expect that you&#39;d already tried them first before asking himlecture notes skip derivations, watch mit 8.03.  BRING A PILLOW, HIS VOICE IS SLOW. prelecture quizzes are easy to guess answers. study as you go. he&#39;s helpful outside class. Test&#39;s aren&#39;t TOO bad. quizzes are hard.  Hes a very caring guy, listen to his advice on the first day about how to study physics (WORK ALONE!) and you&#39;ll be fine :)A lot of useless derivations required for problem sets. Doesn&#39;t realize most students are engineers, not physicists. Teaches very little when it comes to applications, and way too heavy on theory. Flow of class is disorganized. Very bad experience so far.Awesome professor. Entertaining and clear lecturer.Csaba is the best! Very knowledgeable, is able to derive formulas without even consulting his notes. Highly recommend this course! Homeworks are a bit difficult at first, but once you become accustomed to them, you learn a lot.The exam is a lot harder than everything else covered in the course. It was taught very poorly in the areas that made up  45% of the final( a total of 2 lectures were held for these areas).He does a lot of demonstrations which is nice but the lectures are otherwise unorganized and not helpful. The homework is challenging as expected, but the tests are comparatively very easy. Course did not feel indicative of other honors physics courses.  This was his first time teaching the course, and most people say he made it extremely hard for an intro class. The lectures were VERY entertaining, but the homeworks and prelims were definitely difficult. he also missed a bunch of lectures and never posted his office hours. Class was fun though. I enjoyed it a lot.","difficulty":3.4615384615,"rating":3.3076923077},{"index":4439,"prof_name":"Bert Fulbright","prof_dept":"Physics","class_name":"PHYS2216","comment":"Becoming a great physics &#34;teacher&#34; is not easy.Excellent professor.","difficulty":4.0,"rating":4.0},{"index":4440,"prof_name":"Gennady Shvets","prof_dept":"Engineering","class_name":"PHYS2217","comment":"Slow lecturer, awful human being. Not at all sympathetic to extenuating circumstances.PHYS2217 was the biggest mistake of my freshman year. Shvets gives unclear lectures which often left me more confused than when I entered the room. Exams were unreasonably difficult even considering this course is classified as &#34;honors,&#34; evidenced by extremely low exam averages. The curve was a saving grace but not worth the misery of this class.Good luck LOL. The tests in this class are very hard. He&#39;s a good lecturer but sometimes people might get a little confused. But that&#39;s just the nature of the material. Study your ass off for the midterms and try to get an average grade.Prof. Elser is a great guy, he has a weird sense of humor and loves physics a lot. But he&#39;s insane, like he expects that everyone in his class is a genius. This class is the hardest thing I&#39;ve ever done, in my whole life. The homeworks cannot be done outside office hours, but he usually eases off for the prelims since they&#39;re in-class.Fennie is a good guy. As a prof he is mediocre at worst and decent at best. Gets confused sometimes during derivations. Lectures sometimes lack direction, sometimes easy to get bored. His lectures were based almost entirely on the &#34;optional&#34; textbook, Griffiths, while the only thing he used the &#34;required&#34; text (Purcell) for was homework.Really not as bad as some of the other reviews on here make him seem. Overall, lectures are somewhat helpful, but make sure to read to book to reinforce the concepts. Fennie can be a bit unorganized, but he&#39;s still a decent profHis lectures do not help with the psets at ALL. In fact my TAs were much more helpful in terms of problem solving. That being said, he does stress theory in his lectures...which he cannot do well. Makes annoying mistakes during derivations, cannot lucidly and confidently explain a concept...just plain confusing. E&amp;M is a tough topic, but come on.Decent guy. Homework was light (but oddly worded!) for an honors course (4-10 hours per week). He only grades 1 problem per week, and doesn&#39;t have quizzes, so it was hard to self-evaluate; I went to lecture and also re-derived content from textbook + online notes. I felt unprepared for exams but did ok. 2217 labs are a joke, regardless of prof.LOVE DIS GUYI loved this professor! Very interesting lectures. Presents material in a very accessible way, making sure everyone understands. Hope I get to take his class again.Great teacher, interesting and easy-to-understand lectures. Makes problem sets himself and makes them related to each other. Loved his class.Professor Elser is great. Super helpful in office hours and tests are fair.Really good guy who obviously cares about his students. Incredibly smart and knows what he is talking about. PSETs were unreasonably hard and he&#39;s not terribly good at explaining things. On the other hand, reading the textbook is good enough preparation for the exams. Had a pretty good experience overall.Professor Niemack is super smart, knowledgeable, and just a wholesome person overall. His lectures are mostly good, although he doesn&#39;t explain his mathematical derivations in much depth unless specifically asked to do so. That said, he really keeps track of whether the class is keeping up using his excellent (and interesting) i-clicker questions.Made a tough subject next to impossible through his hack-saw grading techniques and misguided, repeated and indistinguishable lectures. Made my semester pretty darn miserable. You may need to higher a professional to decipher his handwriting. Absolutely brilliant researcher, but should never set foot in a classroom.We barely learn anything in lecture - he expects that we read the lecture notes in advance, so there are rarely notes to take. He also is very hard to hear sometimes. HWs are difficult and impossible sometimes to understand what he is asking. And, even though this is &#34;honors&#34; E&amp;M, the &#34;regular&#34; E&amp;M (2213) has harder content and learns more than us!2217 is a little easier than 1116, which is good. Fennie is strange. He brought cake to the final. He spells liek ths and loses track of time sometimes. Grading is also a little suspect. Fennie has gotten better, but he&#39;s still not great. He has a good grasp of the material and answers q&#39;s. If you take this class, Scott Hughes is a good reference.Professor Gibbons was a very engaged professor. Presenting from a theoretical framework, he started with force laws and derived the rest yet also had cool demos. He was even humorous with relevant Batman quotes. In short, the class was very enjoyable.  Gibbons provided ample assistance outside class with office hours and time to help with homework.Professor Gibbons is so far the best professor i&#39;ve had at Cornell.  He always made himself available and really cared that you do well in his class.  Yes, the material was very challenging and i spent many hours studying and preparing for exams, but it is an honors level class.  He made it interesting and encouraged you to do your best.Overall excellent professor. Funny but focused. Lectures were well organized and clear. A difficult first year class (at the level of Purcell\/Morin and Griffiths) but at the end I have definitely learned a lot. Grading was generous; Prof. Xu is more interested in what you learn.Doesn&#39;t seem to understand the material, and no help. Gives the entire department a bad name. Professor Gibbons did a fabulous job with the course. His homework was interesting, his tests were consistently middle-of-the-road fair, and he did a fabulous job making his lectures engaging and interesting. As with any physics class, expect to spend time reading the textbook.

Really needs to work on delivering his material. Seems like assigns random problems for problem sets, because they are often outside the scope of material covered in lecture and readings. Made me suffer for the entire semester.Cannot explain the simplest things and assigns problems outside of readings. His explanations are obscure and counter-intuitive. The textbook was the worst textbook I&#39;ve ever read.The worst professor I&#39;ve ever had. Doesn&#39;t teach the material properly; keeps jumping around the book chapters (we did chapter 10 before chapter 3 for absolutely no reason); claims he covers everything on the exam in lecture, which is absolutely not true. Textboo is also awful, so I had to teach myself this class. Will never take his class again.Recommend to any STEM major as alternative to 2214 (if Davis is teaching). His lectures were very thorough and he takes care to explain everything in detail, answering all questions. Throughout the semester you gain a solid understanding of everything from EM waves to fermi statistics and none of it is rushed. One of the best professors I&#39;ve had.One of the best physics professors Cornell has to offer. Great lecturer. Tests are not too hard - material is closely related to the stuff presented in homework sets and in the textbooks.This guy is a terrible waves professor.  He doesn&#39;t teach concepts at all and forces equations that come from thin air down your throat (think plugging-and-chugging).  Assignments are exceptionally easy (30 minutes avg), but exam difficulty is typically unpredictable.  I love physics and he almost convinced me to drop the major for comparison.Pretty mediocre lecturer. The textbook he used for 2218 sucked. The exams varied wildly in difficulty from one to the next. Homeworks felt too random at times, and not focused enough on the content. Great for the memes, though.What a caring man. Caters and accommodates to all your needs and then some. Responds well to pranks, has watched Friends, just an overall God. You can ask the same question thrice and he&#39;ll patiently answer it in clear, detailed prose. I have nothing but the highest level of respect for this man.Great lecturerHe seemed dedicated and friendly to me. He has a very solid grasp of the material and explains it clearly. He always clearly states what questions he is trying to answer with his derivations, which makes his lectures quite straight forward to follow. He takes the time to answer all of the students&#39; questions. Best physics professor I&#39;ve had yet.The first of the two prelim exams was fairly difficult. You&#39;d best prepare a killer formula sheet then be prepared for tough questions that make you think on the exam. The second exam was really easy. The final covers a lot of thermodynamics so study your thermo during study days.Kim was my favorite physics prof. from the honors intro sequence. She provides the lecture notes in advance which makes most lectures much easier to follow. While 1116 &amp; 2217 required more intuitive thinking to solve crazy problems, 2218 dealt more with becoming familiar with more technical problems. Uses the definite articles incorrrectly at time.The problem sets and prelims are fair so far, and I&#39;m learning a lot in the class. The lectures are pretty clear too and accompany the readings well.Great professor, highly recommended. Clearly cares about teaching. The class was not as hard as 1116\/2217 but I wouldn&#39;t call it easy either.Spring 2019, median A. Eh. Bad textbook. He explained things ok, but homework was only loosely related to lectures - it was from the textbook and too challenging. Hes definitely capable of competent teaching.

Definitely wasn&#39;t as hard as PHYS 1116 or PHYS 2217, but it&#39;s hard to get too theoretical with this content before going too far.  Exams were either too easy (prelim 2) or too hard (final).  Also chose a horrible book (by H. J. Pain) before reading the ratings on Amazon.  Great recipes on his site!Great teacher. Explains things clearly and neatly. He does quantum mechanics in a highly intuitive way and we learn a lot through analogies and comparisons with classical physics.I found Prof Davis to be a good lecturer.  While he does deeply care for the subject, he does not seem to be as interested in the class itself.  I will say that he went over the material rather quickly, and I would have preferred if he had spent more time on each individual topic.  Still, I think he did a good job with the class as a whole.How can I articulate my love for this man? He jumps like a kid seeing good physics, he talks to his chalk, his laugh and passion is contagious, he encourages questions, he brings his dog to the review session at our request, he keeps your chin up when you flop a prelim.

If you take this class, you have to take some to study your book.He&#39;s a good professor and lecturer.

Hard, meaningless homework.Gibbons wants to teach his students, but he can&#39;t, he lacks the ability to keep his students involved, entertained and even interested in the material. he tries and cares, to an extent, but is just a very poorlecturer, and very boring.

Recommended.Going to his lecture is like getting to pay the school for a very uncomfortable place to nap. I&#39;ve done homework for other classes just to keep me awake.BORING class... Spivey is a nice guy, definitely entertaining, but as a lecturer, he could use some improvement in clarity...sleepy time class, good lecture outlines and will listen well in office hoursEasiest class ive ever taken at cornell. The lectures can be a little long and sometimes boring, but a lot of times it also captured my interest. His lecture outlines are great so you dont have to take notes :) Dont read anything for the class you dont need toMy favorite class last semester. Lectures were clear and entertaining, and the posted pdfs\/powerpoints replaced taken notes almost completely. Skimmed over some readings, didn&#39;t do the rest - they were unnecessary for the most part. In-class demonstrations were fun and memorable. Got an A+ and would love to take another class with him.This guy is hilarious!! His lectures are long but interesting and he throws in funny pictures in the slides :) I loved the class!Delightfully down to earth and runs a laid back class. Gives a good broad overview of the subject. High emphasis on lecture rather than readings. Tries hard to make lectures interesting and clear without dumbing them down. Runs a great course for beginning psych students or students looking for an elective on an interesting subject.He is an awesome professor!  Great at explaining things and keeping interest in lectures.  However, he posts his slides, so his lectures are not necessary if you have to miss.  Also, I never did the readings and I did very well in the class.  The tests were easy if you knew the material on the slides.  Overall great class!The class is interesting however the lectures are not as entralling enough to truly appreciate the material.  It is an introductory class, but Spivey could work on the lecutres. On the other hand, his sword is cool, and you can tell he has a lot of enthusiasm for the course.the sword thing was a bit theatrical and didn&#39;t exactly compensate for his lack of clarity but the material in this class is really interestingi love his enthuaism! the subjrct is really fun tooVery light workload and entertaining class, a break from the usual ECE stuff I took. I can&#39;t understand why other reviewers say he&#39;s unclear- he&#39;s explains things very well, and the material is pretty simple to begin with. Subject matter was interesting. Or maybe just compared to engineering?The class is okay, but I&#39;m already sick of his sword.  I also tend to think that I wouldn&#39;t like him too much if I knew him outside of class.Very boring class.  Readings are pretty much worthless.  Not recommended unless fullfills requirement.  Not an easy A either.  Just worthless.  Teacher&#39;s nice enough and occasionally funny, but why does that matter?  I&#39;d rather do less work and get better grades.Spivey is such a nice man!! Great sense of humor\/brilliant\/very kind and understanding!The man looks and acts like a pirate.

Get the notes from a classmate and read the textbook if you have to, but I recommend going to lecture just because it&#39;s fun and interesting. Covers a very broad range of material in little detail but lots of cool case studies.Dr. Segal is an interesting teacher. He wasn&#39;t particularly well suited to be a lecturer for such a large class but he kept things interesting with personal anecdotes. However, his tests were at times unclear and relied heavily on insignificant details aimed to see if you attended class (not if you actually knew basic psych).I&#39;d highly recommend this class and this professor. I&#39;m not a psych major, but the course material can be useful in any field. Professor Pizarro made the lectures easy to understand and entertaining. The class isn&#39;t too stressful; read the book and attend the lectures, and you&#39;ll be fine.This professor is ridiculously boring. I fell asleep every class 5 minutes in. I had an urgent issue during the semester, sent all my professors an e-mail and he was the only one who didn&#39;t respond. I e-mailed him 6 more times in the next week or so and he ignored every one. He obviously doesn&#39;t care about his students.Test wasn&#39;t the most clear but the gives you 10 free points a test.Overall good very fair test but questions are sometimes not related to psychLOVE PIZARRO!!!!! Take this class, you won&#39;t regret it.Solid intro class. Grade is composed solely of 2 prelims and 1 final. Tests are heavily based on the textbook but often had lecture-based questions too, including guest lectures. As long as you study thoroughly, you&#39;ll be fine. If you do all the extra credit, you&#39;ll get a 5% bump on your overall grade which is huge. Great class, great professor.Easiest class ever. Graded on two prelims and a final. All multiple choice. Read the textbook and you&#39;ll be fine, honestly. I can count on one hand the amount of times I actually showed up to lecture, and I still got an A+. EXTREMELY generous extra credit5% on your overall grade just for participating in a few experiments. Kinda hot too, ngl.My favorite class at Cornell so far. Super easy. TED-talk style lecturesattendance isn&#39;t required. I stopped going to class after the second week of the semester and I got a 99.7%. Just make sure you learn the vocabulary from the lectures and the textbook. 5% extra credit for participating in experiments. No assignments. Pizarro&#39;s the man.His lectures are pretty entertaining but you definitely don&#39;t have to go. I just crammed the night before -- slides + textbook + review sheet of important concepts. Also get to do psych experiments online for a free +5% to your course grade.Psychology is a VERY interesting subject, but Prof. Pizarro is not that much... I counted much more on the textbook than on the lectures bc they seemed so forcefully artificial and boring, in general. It&#39;s an easy class, though.Lectures aren&#39;t super useful but they are interesting.I love this man with my entire being. Lectures are interesting, but you don&#39;t have to go. Entire grade is made up of two prelims &amp; a final (all multiple choice; prelims were 45 questions each, final was 60). I stopped going to class after a month and ended up with a 99%. Can get up to 5% extra credit by signing up for experiments (0.5-1 hrs each).Pizarro is the BEST! I was excited to go to lectures; they&#39;re fun, interesting, and engaging. Pizarro is hilarious and super smart and he definitely makes it easy to succeed in the class, This class was easily my favorite and has inspired me to take more Psych courses in the future.Great class if you are looking for something not stressful. Lectures were interesting and contained a lot of information on the test. Professor was always energetic and engaging. One of the best lecturers I&#39;ve had at Cornell.Such a great teacher, I loved going to class three times a week with this guy. He keeps things interesting and relatable and he is outwardly passionate about his field of study.Daves a great guy  lectures may not be mandatory, but its worth going just for the professor.One of the best lecturers I&#39;ve had. His lectures are really interesting and all you really have to do is read the textbook and study his slides. Super chillReally smart and funny guy. I&#39;m not a Psych major but I loved this class. You really have to show up since the exam slides are usually just pictures. Just go to class and read the textbook the night before an exam and you&#39;ll get an A. Median was an A-. Great extra credit too.Lectures are very interesting, as is the textbook (the textbook even throws in jokes and funny things a lot). Easy to do well in the class (if you read), and you learn some interesting stuff. Highly recommend!Easily the best run online course I have had at Cornell. Lectures were done with movie level production value and were extremely entertaining. Very generous extra credit makes it hard not to succeed. Highly recommend.Ive had a really rough semester as a freshman, and things have been more confusing due to COVID. His lectures have gotten me through it all. He is very accommodating to students and reduces our load when were busy with other classes. Weekly quizzes instead of prelims have been a great format for online learningProf cares about students. Psych 1101 is a huge class but well-managed. Very easy.Prof Pizarro is amazing - his lectures online were so high quality and hes super funny and very very kind.Prof Pizarro is awesome. His lectures are so well produced and really engaging. He is so funny and really cares about us getting something out of the class. The online format is tough bc of the weekly quizzes but Im pretty sure thats all run by TAs. Professor Pizarro himself is amazing. Would 1000% take another of his classes.Favorite professor by far at Cornell. His lectures are like stand-up comedy. You probably don&#39;t need to go to lecture to pass, but he&#39;s so funny you&#39;ll want to go. I wish I could retake his class - it&#39;s unlike any other. You do need to study, but take advantage of the summary pages and quizlet for vocab. Extra credit can also boost your grade lotsPizarro is an engaging lecturer. He makes class interesting. Although lectures are great, they are far from necessary as tests are largely based on lecture slides and the textbook. Cram the night before for tests and you&#39;re good.Pizarro&#39;s lectures are funny and interesting, but he is very difficult to get a hold of outside class. However, there are a huge number of TA&#39;s who hold office hours and review sessions and are generally really helpful. The tests aren&#39;t as easy as people claim, but they&#39;re pretty fair and if you study you&#39;ll do well. Plus there&#39;s extra credit.Awesome guy! Very interestingpeople should definitely also check out his podcastPizarro is the coolest :)Really entertaining and interesting!Engaging, funny, hot. What more could you ask for?Really knowledgeable, interesting and engaging. Learned a lot. Perfect level of difficulty for an intro course!Take this class if you want an easy A, minimal in-class learning, and negligible workload. If you want to comprehensively learn and appreciate psychology as a subject, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. Lectures are useless and contain very little substance. 80% of the material is exclusively found in the textbook, so the class is basically auto-tutorial.Pizarro is a really good professor. He&#39;s funny and if you wait long enough after class you can even talk to him. The class is not very demanding, show up if you want (or don&#39;t) the only thing you&#39;ll miss are the potential EC questions and hearing his jokes. You don&#39;t really need to keep up with the reading, but make sure to do extra credit!A lot of reading but as long as you do it, which you will, cause you&#39;ll have no other choice, you&#39;re likely to get an A. Extra credit really helps with that too. I think you need a 94 to make an A but believe me, the work is worth it. Also, lectures are fun because Pizzaro adds all these videos and experiments which make it interesting.Best class at Cornell! This is a must-take class and you&#39;re ensured an A as long as you read the material covered well. Lectures are amazing and Prof. Pizzaro is hilarious. The exams are all multiple choice questions and the material is very interesting. If I could, I would definitely take this class again. Also, you get extra credit very easily.If you show up to class, take notes, and read the textbook you will do fine in this class. If you don&#39;t read, prepare for the exams because they will wreck you. Besides that, Pizarro is an amazing lecturer that makes sure you always feel engaged and aren&#39;t bored in class.The chillest professor I&#39;ve ever had. Lectures are amazing. Just take notes and read the textbook. Prelims are multiple choice.His lectures were not helpful but they were entertaining.He is a great lecturer. very entertaining and engaging and interesting material.Your grade is based on 3 prelims so make sure you know the material well. His lectures are kinda pointless but sometimes his prelims ask questions that you would know the answer to only if you were in class. He&#39;s really funny and cute but it wasn&#39;t my fave class.He is the best lecturer I&#39;ve ever had so far. His lectures were very engaging, his sense of humor was great, he always managed to make the class laugh. His PowerPoints were not flooded with text, which made it essential to go to class. His exams were very fair, and he tested material that appeared both in his lecturers and the textbook. AMAZING!!!He is a really easy professor. If you show up to class and read the textbook before the exams, you will easily get at least a B+. If you just memorize the concepts he tells you to memorize you will do really well.I love Pizarro&#39;s lectures. He&#39;s a funny guy and the lectures are definitely amusing, if not all relevent. I made the mistake of relying too heavily on information provided in the lectures rather than the information in the textbook. Your whole grade is based on three exams, and most of the work needs to be done outside of class. Pizarro is a good professor. I had him for Psych 1101. While his lectures did not always keep me fully engaged, it was a class I did not mind going to. The class is not hard but do not blow it off. You have to study and read the textbook and work hard for a good grade if you want one.This class was great! If you do all the readings and study before the 3 tests you are golden. The material was interesting, and Pizarro did a good job at lectures, although sometimes he rambled on and got unfocused. He is really a great guy with some really interesting research. Would take again in a heartbeat!Pizarro is a genuinely funny and nice guy. He teaches interesting material and is engaging, though it is difficult in such a big class. He posts helpful guides for the prelims and basically told us 80% of what would be on the final word for word. There is barely any work, just readings, but there is some studying involved. Recommend highlyA bit scattered and disorganized in lecture but tries hard to engage the students despite the large size. An okay lecturer but a nice professor who is more than willing to see his students succeed.Hard to stay interested and engaged in such a large class but Pizarro is hilarious. If you need something fun and easy give it a shot.AMAZING CLASS. Hands-down my favorite class taken at Cornell so far. He is so funny and well-respected, and does a good job providing examples to current trends so that students can feel personally connected to the work. Very relevant info to a wide realm majors here, and not too hard if you do the readings. HIGHLY recommend this class to anyone.","difficulty":2.0961538462,"rating":4.1538461538},{"index":4566,"prof_name":"Khena Swallow","prof_dept":"Psychology","class_name":"PSYCH1102","comment":"Hardest class I&#39;ve taken, may not even pass.Very dry professor with a very disorganized courseHorrible class with busy work and a horrible, disorganized professorLectures are extremely dry, and you cannot skip due to mandatory GRADED iClicker questions. Majority of lectures are disorganized and she often comes unprepared for class.Dont take her classes ever. Very dull and dry lectures. Her TAs did a better job lecturing and getting the class engaged.The course itself is interesting if not for the professor. She is extremely unprofessional and not careful with grading. Warning: go see your test after you take it there will be errors. This year a &#34;computing&#34; error dropped everyone&#39;s grades a week later because she couldn&#39;t be bothered to grade the tests right the first time.Overall, I enjoyed this class. Cognitive science can get deep and technical rather quickly, bleeding into computer science, philosophy, and linguistics. So, developing and teaching an introductory-level cognitive science course is no trivial matter, but I believe that Professor Swallow and her staff did a great job.The class is an easy A if you go to class and actually study the lecture slides (you really don&#39;t need to purchase the book). Professor Swallow seems like a genuinely nice person, but unfortunately is such a bad professor. It is so hard to understand, very long and monotonous lectures, and the class is entirely disorganized. Tests have questions that are never mentioned in class or the readings. Overall: DO NOT TAKE.Probably the most boring professor I have ever listened to. Complete and total waste of 27.5 hours of my life that I would do anything to get back. First lecture she mentions how taking notes by hand is more useful but she doesn&#39;t even give enough time to type half of the slide down. Asks what you think, talks about everyone&#39;s answer and goes on.Swallow&#39;s class has potential to be much more interesting than it actually is; she&#39;s passionate about the material but lacks any enthusiasm in teaching resulting in boring lectures. Class is very easy though since 1 prelim gets dropped completely, and you can make up participation on piazza. Overall recommend.*** Textbook may be needed for those select few clicker quiz questions*** Material could be much more interesting if presented in a different way, but overall she&#39;s a pretty good lecturer. Participation plays a heavy role because every lecture, we have graded iclicker questions based on the previous lecture&#39;s material\/reading. Memorization mostly.Sometimes funny and interesting, but boring and slow at other times. He&#39;s not rude to students, at least not in this semester. Readings are boring, and tests have vague multiple choice answers sometimes. And this is cognitive SCIENCE. Expect some technical stuff.

No real conclusions drawn from the course, but still some exposure to &#39;fun-to-know&#39; type stuff.This class is hard. You have to be on top of everything and I mean every litte detail. I recommend taking this class if you have a easy course load. If not don&#39;t stress yourself out--Cornell is stressful already.Never had a more competent and organized professor. He takes information from a wide range of disciplines and condenses it into these really impressive lectures. It&#39;s not easy to get an A, but it&#39;s worth it. I learned a lot. Not much reading. Show up, take good notes, and you&#39;ll do well. Don&#39;t take the optional final!!Prof. Cutting is my advisor. Class was decently hard. The tests were very hard because they involved very detailed memorization of truck-load of material. If you have a very good photographic memory of every page of text and lecture then you are garanteed to get an A or better in class. Last minute cramming will definitely not cut. Highly curved!Lectures are very good, but simplistic from my opinion. The course is easilly passable if you just go to lectures, and you can get a good grade if you do anything more. Its an interesting course, and it was great as a low-workload distribution course.Really enjoys the subject.  His presentations are very clear, although his tests are really difficult (the curves are generous though).  I would definitely reccommend taking a class with him.He shines with brilliance and his enthusiasm for the material. Tests are super hard. But I loved the lectures. Seldom have I looked forward so much to going to class.very clear, knowledgable professor. Difficult exams, but absolutely possible to get good grades if you go to lectures and keep up with the stuff.

But it&#39;s clear he&#39;s an expert in what he&#39;s talking about, and has many different interests. He&#39;s a true intellect, and extremely helpful during office hours. Great guyProfessor Cutting is an absolute genius and his lectures are fascinating. He talks a lot about art and is a very engaging lecturer overall. His exams are difficult, but if you attend lecture, read the book, and study a lot, you CAN get an A. Definitely recommend.I didn&#39;t read the textbooks, just did my best to memorize the glossary terms from the assigned readings. I took extremely detailed notes of everything he SAYS. Memorize everything you can. His delivery of the lecture was most important. I learned a lot in this class and appreciate Prof Cutting&#39;s dedication and passion for these topics :DLectures and textbook cover different material with some overlap, and you have to study both for exams. In-class pop &#34;essays&#34; (really just a 2-3 sentence response to a basic question) count for 10%, top two exam scores (out of 2 prelims and the final) each count for 45%. Exams are short answer and require lots of memorization.At the very first lecture, Professor Cutting states that while he knows everyone here are at the top of their game in their respective high school classes, he is here to separate the very best from the best. And he does this by making his notes extremely disorganized and exams ridiculously hard. Knowledgeable professor but horrible teacher.Yes the tests are really hard, but this class is very fair overall. Best formula to get an A: GO to lecture, write down about half of what he says, learn the bold terms in the book, and study hard for tests. Cutting is a masterful lecturer, very intelligent and knowledgeable. Boring every once in a while but usually fascinating, original material.An incredibly thorough, clear, and well-organized teacher. Exams were detailed, but very fair. He also let the entire class know outright that lecture material and text readings would be distinct from one another, but that both would be covered on prelims. Hands-down one of the most competent people I&#39;ve learned something from at Cornell.His lecture slides by themselves are not too helpful. The real stuff happens in the professor&#39;s delivery in class. So attending lecture is key. If you make it, the lectures are fascinating and well-delivered; if you don&#39;t, well, good luck trying to infer the content from pictures and random terms.

Its not easy,his tests are demanding but ive managed to do well with enough studying.He&#39;s decent. His fetish with rat pups is quite obvious and he talks about it any chance he gets.

A standard lecture might be: &#34;this is systemogenesis... oh by the way, rats pups are cool, but we&#39;ll talk about it next week. where was i?&#34;He&#39;s a good professor who tries to make the material interesting and loves what he does. Yet, his lecture material is often unorganized and difficult to follow. Tests are moderate; memorize it all and you&#39;ll do well.Incredibly interesting lecturer who is very active in the field. If you&#39;re at all interested in development this class is a must-take. Beware the tests: the class covers a lot of material and you really have to know a lot about (tests are more or less exclusively essays)The tests for this class are TOUGH (almost no multiple choice).  Make sure you do all the reading (there&#39;s a ton) because you&#39;ll be expected to know a lot of specific studies on the tests.

I love Professor Goldstein! My favorite professor so far. He made lectures fun and interesting.The sweetest professor I have ever had. He will go OUT OF HIS WAY to help you. He is very clear in lecture, and is quite funny in his lovable, nerdy way. Class is very do-able, but the TA&#39;s are very mean, curt, harsh, and rude. But you will learn a lot, and as long as you study his outlines\/go to his review sessions for tests you&#39;ll do fineGoldstein is great!! Amazing lecturer! Very interested in his field and makes material interesting. His lectures are casual and enjoyable. Exams are essays, and are not to bad, but TA grading is ridiculous. Other than TAs, class is great! Highly recommended.Excellent lecturer. Really passionate about material that is otherwise pretty dull.  Just  a great guy overall. And plus, he talks about babies, how can you possibly go wrong.Best professor I&#39;ve had thus far. Incredibly knowledgeable and enthusiastic- he knows his stuff. Make sure you GO TO CLASS. He covers a lot of information in detail, a lot of which is not on the lecture slides or in the readings. The study guides are essential for passing prelims; attend the review sessions. Prelims are very thorough.great lecturer and interesting materials! Prof Goldstein knows his stuff, and his lecture can be really spontaneous. I wouldn&#39;t say it is an easy course, but if you are willing to learn and study really hard for it, you should do just fine. Pay close attention to every thing he delivers in class and use the outline to review.First time taking a psych class as an engineer for liberal arts credit. Pretty easy class. I&#39;ve decided it doesn&#39;t really suit my interest but Professor Goldstein is a good lecturer who really cares about the material and making sure you learn it rightMike is a great professor and makes the class really enjoyable. He&#39;s very laid-back, but energetic during lectures and loves what he does. It&#39;s not an easy class, but your grade will be fair. Ask him something after class, he&#39;s a wealth of knowledge. Highly recommended class, especially for PSYCH\/HD majors.You really have to study for his tests, but he always gives out a &#34;what-to-study&#34; outline beforehand - know everything on it (be able to write a few sentences about each bullet) and you&#39;re golden. I feel like I actually LEARNED something (not just memorized). Also, the final is a great chance to bring your grade up (I went from a C to an A).Great Professor, very energetic and knowledgeable. Learnt a lot in class! Tests are hard, so you must study and  prepare... Takenote is useful for this class.  It&#39;s a great class overall!He is definitely one of the most entertaining professors I&#39;ve had and he knows his stuff, as demonstrated by his ability to cite experiments or researchers appropriate for just about anything related to babies.Tests can be difficult, but he&#39;s very clear about what material you should study.  Occassional homework assignments are easy grade boosters.Best lecturer I&#39;ve had at Cornell. He&#39;s really passionate about his field, and helpful for anyone pursuing psychology as a career. Tests are really fair and easy if you attend lecture and use the test outlines. ONLY read the parts of the textbook on the outline; I got an A and didn&#39;t read it at all. Attend all lectures, though.A very good lecturer. His tests were not easy, but he provided us with an outline of everything we needed to know. I agree with the person who posted below that the final can be a major grade booster if you study hard for it.Interesting material. This course is really just about going to all class and taking intensive notes. Write down 65-75% of what he says (TAs grade picky), use outlines to study for tests, rehearse material, spit back his language, and you\u2019re on your way to an A.

Also, very difficult to stay awake in class (I have taken Cognitive Science before and that was waaay more interesting than this course).Probably the worst class I have ever taken at Cornell.

To call this class completely incomprehensible would be a huge improvement and an enormous compliment to Edelman. He almost certainly makes up the vast majority of the &#34;intellectual&#34; diarrhea that he lectures about and he clearly needs to be fired.For what it&#39;s worth, I dropped this class during the first lecture because I knew I wanted nothing to do with this professor after the first five minutes.

He is a great lecturer but his tests are hard and he has quite the ego.Good teacher and class if you are interested in the subject, otherwise you&#39;ll probably go nuts because it moves fast and is challenging. He is a good lecturer though. Major downside: he tests on little things from the reading (like factoids in the side boxes). Don&#39;t worry about detailed descriptions from the textbook though.This class was pretty challenging. The professor did a good job of explaining things in lecture, but it was still hard to know what to learn for the exams. I took the class pass\/fail, but going into the final, I wasn&#39;t confident that I would pass. The writing assignments are easy and help your grade. I would recommend the class, but expect to work.AVOID THIS CLASS. Does not respond to emails. Lecture slides are vague. First year teaching this class, an INTRO level course. Blackboard has nothing useful, we have 2 &#34;writing assignments&#34; due at our final, NO information has been posted regarding it. Ridiculous amount of content for tests; mix of book &amp; lecture. Class avg is around C-. Miserable.I never write reviews. However, I needed to in this case. AVOID THIS CLASS if it&#39;s taught by him. Students have no idea about what&#39;s going to be on the test. Literally studied like crazy for this class and still got a C- because tests were so random. barely learned from reading the textbook and going to lectures. All around HORRIBLE TEACHERLast sem was the first time Devoogd taught this class, and it was definitely more challenging than I expected. However, if you studied (focusing on what he covered in class and using the book to get the smaller details), you do fine. Extremely helpful at explaining concepts if you can go to his office hours. Doesn&#39;t respond to emails very quickly. Impossible tests. Do not take unless you have photographic memory so you can memorize the textbook. Expects essays on short response.  No multiple choice at all. Lectures are too one-dimensional and are really quite useless. His lectures, however, go over small details that somehow show up on the test. Good, interesting and inspiring lectures, which explain the topics well. Attending the lectures is important to score well. Most of the test material is covered in class, and things he teaches in lectures are far more likely to come on the tests than the general stuff in the text, you can probably just study from his power points and do fine.If you do attend the lectures, take notes while you read, and actually study, the exams aren&#39;t too bad. Smith&#39;s lectures are really good. He is great at clarifying complicated topics, an is an engaging lecturer. Easy grades on papers, EC opportunities, can drop one prelim. 2 papers about 3 pages, 3 prelims (drop 1), plus a finalGreat prof, great class.  Lots of rats.Awesome professor. His lectures are extremely organized and easy to follow. He makes somewhat tedious material very interesting. Most of the material on exams are from lectures, but he does require that you read the book. He drops the lowest exam grade which helped me a lot. Definitely recommended.I personally feel that this class wasn&#39;t as hard as the reviews suggest. Exams make up 90% of final grade. He gave 5% extra credit, which I had 4. GO TO THE LECTURES, or you can in no way figure out how to answer some of the questions. Before exams, memorize his slides carefully, and study the pictures and reviews in the textbook. Median was a B+.Very good professor and great course. Smith is clear and makes a de facto neurobiology course unintimidating without dumbing it down. He knows you are absorbing a ton of specific information and writes fair tests. The simple formula works: read and go to class, which gets increasingly interesting. A nice enough man who entertains (common) regrades.This is an interesting class, but the professor gives no details about what he expects and everything is a surprise. On test, each question is graded separately but no correct answers or feedback is given. He goes on tangents about animals and his research and his friends&#39; research in lecture and tests on small details so pay attention.David is exactly the kind of prof. I have been looking for. He&#39;s smart, interested, engaging, knowledgable, loves answering questions (we didn&#39;t get to some lecture material at the end of the text because we asked so many questions). The text is great and I read every page, I recommend doing the same. Definitely learned a lot from him and the textGonna be real frank about this - one of the worst decisions of my life was taking this course. Terribly unclear lectures, incompetent professor, harsh and arbitrary grading, and extremely inconsiderate attitude towards students. Upon contemplating the fact that he is a professor at an Ivy League, I found myself close to a mental breakdown. DisgraceAll jokes aside - worst class you will take at Cornell. Unbelievably incompetent, at times self-contradicting, unclear Professor. Any remotely positive reviews are lying - do not listen to them. Very difficult tests with unanticipated questions. Multiple attempts should be made to get Professor removed from Cornell. Disgrace to Cornell.Honest review: Hardest class Ive taken at Cornell (Senior, 4.0 GPA). Its honestly shocking to see any positive reviews of the course on here. The class wasnt so difficult because of the material - but because the Professor is extremely unclear &amp; tests have ridiculously unanticipated, specific questions. I dont understand how he is a professor.This course was fairly straightforward. Tests are all short answer, and they are based almost exclusively on material covered in the lectures (though questions are occasionally ambiguous). You do not really need the textbook. Just study the slides and recordings. For some reason, DeVoogd doesnt always emails, so use office hours if needed.He gives no information as to what you should focus on for the prelims. The prelim questions are kind of a surprise which makes it all the more difficult since they are all short-answer questions.The Behavioral Neuroscience (biopsychology) class was all lectures. There was nothing interactive about the entire class; just lectures and then the prelims. The lectures were dry and mostly stuff from the textbook. The syllabus says the textbook is mandatory, but I never had to use it. The prelims are long and many short answer questions.He&#39;s a great professor. Definitely the best I have. The lectures are fairly interesting, but definitely read the textbook. He lectures well and tries to keep things interesting. He&#39;s also good about reminding of assignments and tests and telling what will be on the test.Awesome professor. Really nice and approachable.He is nice person who is passionate and kind. I would not take this class again though bc the 3 exams that make up 90% of your grade are ENTIRELY short answer &amp; he expects ridiculously specific answers without giving clear specificity in the questions.DeVoogd is an all around great guy. Cares about his students and is very helpful outside of class. You definitely need to work hard, but the resources are there and he wants to help.Interesting lecturer. Some material was pretty dry, but for the most part, classes were interesting. His tests are pretty easy (if you study a little, you&#39;ll be fine, and he drops the lowest one anyways). The few short papers we had to write were also graded very leniently. Good professor.I thought he was an excellent professor. He made material which I often found confusing in the textbook crystal clear. Tests are hard though, so you definitely have to read the book and study, but he&#39;s always willing to clarify things you don&#39;t understand.","difficulty":3.7407407407,"rating":3.5555555556},{"index":4580,"prof_name":"David Smith","prof_dept":"Psychology","class_name":"PSYCH2330","comment":"Very good explanations.

Thom (as he signs his emails) is an interesting guy teaching a *very* dry subject. Intro stats can be memorized, which makes it pretty boring.

Definitely take advantage of office hours and any extra practice you can get. Great class and professor.Knowledgable professor but he cannot communicate information clearly to students. Powerpoint slides are not very helpful. Prelims draw from pure memorization of random definitions.Good class, great lecturer. She breaks down the equations and clearly explains the concept behind each. You will learn a lot in this class. You also gain skills in SPSS if you take the 4-credit hour version.She&#39;s very nice, but a very boring lecturer. You are supposed to read the chapter ahead of class and then she just reviews the chapter in class with the example problems already given in the book. Not fun, but you can learn a fair amount from the class.Amazing lecturer. I greatly looked forward to attending class. She makes learning statistics so easy!

You&#39;ve got to pre-enroll early though, it gets filled up quickly.This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines.The worst professor I have had so far. Completely destroyed my interest in psychology and has no idea how to lecture. Reads off the lecture slides yet refuses to post them before class. The only times I actually went to class I fell asleep. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!\n \n to the poster two above me: she had to curve it (i.e. add points to everyone tests which is not curving) because everyone did so poorly. and then she told us that we needed to study better!Shes a really good professor. She brings enthusiasm to the lectures, and explains things clearly. She tries to cover a little too much in lecture, so it can be hard 2 keep up. The test are challenging, but not that bad, they just can&#39;t be blown off.She was helpful and unpretentious during office hours, and she&#39;s given me useful advice about what other classes to take at Cornell. She also helped me get a RA position in one of the social psych labs. I think she somewhat shy which leads people to think she&#39;s cold. She&#39;s obviously new at teaching, and that&#39;s where mots of her pitfalls lie.Don&#39;t take this class unless you have to. The prof is unreasonable and makes the tests hard for no reason. When someone asked for a study guide, she said the 35 slide powerpoints for each lecture were the guide. For the final, she said the previous prelims were the guide, but she never gave them back and wouldn&#39;t let you have them. Ridiculous.One of the worst classes I&#39;ve had at Cornell.  Tests trivial information, doesn&#39;t show up for her own review sessions.  She seems sweet but I don&#39;t care!  She is unpolished and I would strongly advise that if you want to learn about Personality Psych to simply buy the book.No CommentsLectures: not engaging, dragging, undynamic, way too easy to skip. Tests difficult, not in the good challenging sense, but in that they don&#39;t really test your knowledge at all, but seemingly unimportant random minutia from lectures and textbook. Cold, distant, and unresponsive at office hours. As psych major, this class was a waste of my time.She knows what she&#39;s talking about. She&#39;s new at teaching so there are some things she still is learning, but she&#39;s a very very smart person. The class can be interesting if you are into the material, but don&#39;t take if you&#39;re just looking for an easy electiveShe is a good professor who knows what she&#39;s doing.  Lectures are occasionally boring, but they are always clear if you pay attention. She&#39;s incredibly sweet and helpful if you ever visit her office hours, and because she&#39;s new, people really take advantage by complaining\/picking on her so much. Tough class, and well worth it.Boring class, put me to sleep.  Tests test material which is directly from the book, final is worth 50% of you grade!I would not recommend the prof.  Test are impossible and many questions are ambiguous.  She is new, and doesn&#39;t really know what she is doing yet. She was a little nasty at office hours and really fake. The material learned was really interesting even though she is so bad at teaching it. I&#39;ll probably get a A-, and I still don&#39;t like her.No personality. Horrible lecture, can&#39;t master ppt slides (clicks through all the important stuff in a sec and spends 30 min on a blank slide)  Also can&#39;t write test questions well.  Random useless knowledge tested, not concepts (eg was a test given in tibetan or bushman, what was word 36 on page 321, etc) Speaks at 2 microdecibels. Poor TA contactUseless class. Lecture is mindnumbingly boring (went maybe 3 times all semester), exams don&#39;t actually test real knowledge, the book is painful to read, and Zayas is new (it shows).

Material is super interesting, but there is a lot of it. Prof. Zayas is great. Engaging. The prelim is reasonable if you focus on the study guide.There is a ton of reading, the exams are very hard. I find this class harder than organic chemistry, which is the worst class I&#39;ve ever taken. The means are low, and there is no curve. Professor Zayas is a very good lecturer, though. Most of the information from lectures is not on the slides, so it is important to go to lecture.Reading according to schedule is the key. She is a good lecturer but not at all an easy professor. Lecture will just help you understand but actual contents for the prelims will be from textbook and readings. Take advantages of all extra credit opportunities. Only take it if you&#39;re interested in this area. Challenging prelims but doable if you try.Very intelligent lecturer, but her class was incredibly challenging. You will need to study very diligently just to pull off anything above a B from personal experience. The amount of readings for the class are through the roof. I learned a lot from the class, but seriously, only take this class if you have strong interest in the topic.Class is much,much harder and more intensive than it should be. I have no clue why it isn&#39;t a 4 credit course for the amount of work it involves. Overall, not worth it if you just need an easy psych course. There are plenty of better, more interesting, less time consuming psych courses offered..Honestly, pretty easy class. I took it as a freshman and had no problem with the class. The study guide IS EXACTLY the same as the prelim.. if you know the study guide, you WILL do well. The lectures helped but I skipped a bunch and still did fine because everything was posted online.. Readings weren&#39;t mandatory; you just have to know the main ideaProf. Z is a great lecturer and a really cool person. She often cites her own studies which I love. You need to go to the lectures even though the slides are posted- otherwise you won&#39;t understand them. And you need to read the textbook and outside readings. It&#39;s work.Honestly thought I would have received a worse grade, but extra credit helped exponentially! Amazing ideas and concepts that are applicable, stayed awake every lecture. Test questions are tricky, so really know everything front to back. Worked the hardest for this class out of all of my classes. Use the learning objective questions!I loved psych until I took this class. By far the worst class I have ever taken. EVER.Very knowledgeable and organized but, but an easy A she is not.

Gilovich rocks!Neat guy. Knows the subject intimately; he&#39;s really well-known in the social psychology world. Heck, he was one of the co-authors of the brand new (and very useful) textbook. Good sense of humor, too. But yeah, prelims are pretty hard. Take good notes (or get TakeNote) and do all of the readings carefully, especially in the textbook!Take this class! Gilovich and Regan give you lecture outlines, which means that instead of frantically scribbling notes for 75 minutes straight, you can listen to the (mostly entertaining) lectures. Gilovich throws in a lot of fun material, and is clearly passionate about psychology. The textbook he co-wrote is sometimes even-- gasp!-- fun to read.Gilovich is the greatest! He&#39;s very intelligent and extremely amusing. The subject is interesting, but Gilovich makes it intriguing. I signed up for 350 next semester cause I thought Gilovich was teaching it, but it turns out he&#39;s not, and I am really sad. Oh well. Definitely take 280!Not only is Gilovich brilliant, but his lectures are interesting and even humorous. Sometimes his lectures are identical to the reading, but that&#39;s because he co-wrote the textbook. Tests are tricky, but if you go to class, do the reading, and study, you will do fine.Very hard class (tests are brutal). Very nice and helpful guy (I found him a bit less helpful than Regan). Lectures are very interesting and good.  Great classA pretty good, entertaining lecturer. BTW, I strongly disagree with the person who perferred Gilovitch over Regan. They\u2019re both good profs - Gilovitch might be more charming, but I think Regan actually has the edge on explaining things and caring about students. Good class overall if you&#39;re into it.Interesting lectures, but incredibly unclear and tangential.  Designs tests to be intentionally difficult and low-scoring.  Irrational requisite for attention to detail.  Requires much more work than the average course in the department.  Only advised for students who have a profound interest in the subject matter.Loved his class.  If you think he&#39;s overrated, know it isn&#39;t so: I read his book as an undergrad, and now 10 years later I have to read it again for a law school class.Gilovich is awesome.  He is very intelligent and always clear.  I wish it was just Gilovich teaching this class (rather than him and Regan).This is the most boring class I ever took at Cornell.

Verdict: Interesting Topic, poor professor.Very good lecturer. Engaging, never very dull, and very clear explanations. However, exams are very tough (means in  low 60s usually).

GREAT CLASS.  tough graderHe is probably the best prof I&#39;ve had at cornell. He&#39;s extremely interesting and a fantastic lecturer. He uses the book he wrote for the class and the readings were almost enjoyable to do. The prelims were pretty hard but they&#39;re curved so it doesn&#39;t matter too much. Not the easiest course in the world but not a lot of work definitely worth it!Incredible, incredible speaker-- never even went close to nodding off during his class. The way he presents material is incredible. (Tests are hard, not going to lie, but if you do the reading and really remember the experiments it talks about, you&#39;ll do well. Another plus-- he helped write the book, so all the lecture stuff is covered.)I was a little surprised about how boring I found this class, especially with all the comments on this site. He was my least engaging teacher, and would throw a TON of experiments at you for each topic. The tests were graded unnecessarily harsh, too. He curves, though, so don&#39;t worry. And I recommend taking notes on the slides as you go.Gilovich is by far one of the most captivating lecturers at Cornell. Fascinating subject and he makes it fun and interesting. His class was tough, but if you attend classes and do the reading you will be fun. Definitely take this before you leave Cornell!Lectures are just him rambling on for 75 minutes trying to get as much material out there as possible as opposed to, how much can my students take in. The readings cover several times more material than lectures, so by exam time you have too much to remember. Really low means on exams, like 60%, full of weird questions.Professor Gilovich is a great guy, but this class was SO hard. The prelims were ridiculous and borderline unfair. He packed so much info into his lectures that it was nearly impossible to stay awake and keep good notes. I tried really hard in this class, and it still didn&#39;t pay off. Only take this class if you love psych more than anything.Goes on ad nauseum about the smallest details and typically goes off on a tangent during his lectures. I am a psych major, and even I have difficulty finding interest in his lectures. At least the TA is bearable.I took him for Social Psych and the class was fantastic! He&#39;s a really great lecturer and the material was really interesting. His prelims were really hard though; he&#39;s REALLY into nitpicky details from the book that you could overlook. Despite the hard tests though, it&#39;s a great class!While psych 2800 requires a little bit of work, it is worth it.  Very interesting and a must-take for psych majors and a great class for non psych majors.Really great lecturer. Tests are a little hard and readings can make or break you on exams. He is a little scattered sometimes but overall I had a great experience with him as a lecturer! He also held review sessions before tests, which were nice.Gilovich is the man. This course is the best. Take it if you want to be a better person.I really love this professor. You can tell he genuinely cares about every student. I just showed up to class everyday and paid attention. I read the spark notes of the assigned reading and skimmed the slides the day before the exam and aced it. The class is actually interesting and not stressful. He goes on a lot of tangents but still worth taking.I took Gilovich&#39;s class more than a decade ago and count his social psychology class as formative and pivotal during those years in college when I was finding myself. Fear of a bad grade should not deter you from taking his enjoyable and thought-provoking classes.Psych 2800 is a great class, the tests are a little tricky but overall everything was good. Make sure to do the readings!Gives extremely convoluted explanations on topics. Not the best lecturer. Least favorite class at Cornell so far. Does not really care about logistics. Do not take it if you are not a psych major. I have taken several classes that covered some experiments taught in this class and still find it quite hard to follow. Tests are unfair and hard.The best professor I have ever had. Class is interesting and thought-provoking; tests are very fair and doable if you do the readings. 10\/10 would recommend!!!If you do the readings and go to lecture you&#39;ll be fine.  If you don&#39;t like psychology dont take the class because it is a lot of reading and remembering experiments. Gilovich is a brilliant professor and will inspire you to think of the world in a new way.Loved this class, so many interesting ideas applicable to everyday life. He is a fantastic lecturer and he also offered a review session before every test that I would recommend. This class is hard however. Make sure that you do the readings because his exams can be tricky. One of my favorite classes at Cornell.Professor Gilovich was perhaps the greatest lecturer I have ever had while in school. He made each class interesting and applicable while crafting lectures to interest his audience. My only regret is that I didnt take a course with him sooner to allow me to take more courses that he teaches. Highly recommendPrelims are very difficult, but the papers are graded easy. Hard to do really well but if you do the readings and go to to class you should be in decent shape. He&#39;s not very accessible, the times I asked for help I didn&#39;t get it. Personally I&#39;d avoid this class specifically, it was too much work for an elective.PowerPoints are so vague, if you miss lecture, all you will see are pictures on the slides with no notes to help you out. He wrote the textbook, so expect to read a lot. Prelim questions are so specific, which is not ideal for an introductory course. Passionate about his field, but VERY politically bias in how he presents materials.As a psych major, found this course relatively straightforward. Extra credit and office hours really helped me get the A. Extremely interesting and relevant course material that I talk about them to people outside of class. Don&#39;t focus on the minute details, but sit back and listen to understand the concepts, and ask a lot of questions!My favorite class at Cornell, definitely take it. So interesting and applicable to daily life. Gilovich is a rock star in the psych world and he knows all the material by heart + wrote the textbook. Both prelims and the final are horribly specific. Read the textbook word for word. Attendance not required but will definitely help you on the testThe best professor I&#39;ve ever had. Interesting, intelligent and incredibly talented at explaining concepts during lecture. Go to lecture and do the readings and you&#39;ll be fine. Pre-lims are slightly difficult but fair. Lecture is always interesting. Term paper is easy but make sure to incorporate a lot of your own ideas Interesting material and interesting lecturer! Long class time but he mostly keeps my attention. TAs are super nice as well. Make sure youre familiar with all the studies he goes over in class, as there are very few grading opportunities. But, I really enjoyed the class &amp; Gilovich so it made it an easy A for me personally. :)Professor Gilovich is one of my favorite professors. He really knows his stuff and shares it with you in a really interesting way. I really enjoyed his lectures. That said, his tests can be hard, even when you study; there&#39;s a lot of nitpicky details from the books. Overall, definitely take the class. You learn a TON of interesting things!Terrible class. Gilovich clearly cares and knows his stuff, but the class is very poorly organized. It&#39;s a large lecture for a topic that NEEDS to be taught through discussion, so lectures end up being him rambling about random topics in psychology. Grading is unfair, super harsh, and nitpicky. Unless you&#39;re a psych. major, DON&#39;T take this class.Gilovich is a great professor. He is smart and his lectures are incredibly interesting. He is quite a rockstar in psych and he exudes knowledge about the subject. The tests are straightforward though they require a very thorough reading of the textbookCaptivating professor. He posts lecture slides, but I found that I could have taken better in-class notes. He includes questions directly from the textbook on the prelims and final, so read the textbook. He doesn&#39;t return prelims but lets you see them during OH, and he reuses several questions on the final. Final40% Prelims20% Paper10%The lectures are fine. The problem is the material. You learn little about social psychology. Instead, you memorize experiments. Take the class if you are a psych major. Otherwise, stay far away.  He also claimed that psych majors know more about economics than econ majors, so I guess his brain just works differently than everybody else. Ironic.Great man w\/ lots of positive energy. Rambles and focuses too much on the experiments and his prelims are too tough. Pretty interesting subject that happens to fall flat at times. You need to know every single reading in and out, attending lectures sort of helps. Again, prelims are too tough.Tests you on ridiculously minute details, oftentimes mentioned in passing during lecture or readings. ALWAYS go to class, do the readings beforehand, study, and you will do fine. Slack off and those tests will kill you.","difficulty":3.5476190476,"rating":3.7380952381},{"index":4588,"prof_name":"Tom Gilovich","prof_dept":"Psychology","class_name":"PSYCH2801","comment":"I took writing section (WIM), so experience was different.

We took a prelim 5 weeks ago and still have not received grades. Its unacceptable.One of the best professor at Cornell ever! He is so smart, caring, funny and inspring!!! Cornell is luck to have him. He tells some amazing stories to illustrate his concept and broaden your perspectives. Amazing TAs, very dedicated.(especially Bernie).No CommentsNo Commentsthe most wonderful professor i&#39;ve ever met. i would be lost if it was not for his encouragement throughout my undergrad yearsA must take class with a must have professor! Don&#39;t miss out on this great opportunity to learn and be entertained while doing it.Prof Segal is a great pedagogue in many ways, but know this: he teaches using examples and emotionally connecting with the students. This is great for about 80% of the course. However, he is NOT great at teaching &#34;systems&#34;, which is the other 20%. He reverts to his use of examples, but the mechanisms often go unexplained at the fundamental level.Best professor everProf Segal is awesome. His lectures are engaging and informative. The tests are incredibly fair. You will do as well as you want to in this course. I wish there were more profs like Segal, who actually loves teaching.Most incompetent professor ever, No organization, Give no indications or false indications of what is expected, Completely arbitrary gradingThe best professor I&#39;ve ever had.No CommentsTells interesting stories and brings a sword to class.  Very friendly, interesting guy.  Likes to talk about his daughter too much, and gets many guest lecturers when he doesn&#39;t know the material.What a lovable guy! The girls go nuts for him because he is such a sweetheart. Gives you practical pointers for life. Lectures are ridiculously interesting because they feature case studies, readings are interesting as well. Tests are very fair. Exam reviews pointless because they are disorganized.He was one of the most incompetent teacher I&#39;ve had at Cornell. I don&#39;t know why there are so many good reviews of him. While he may be a good &#34;person,&#34; his credibility in teaching this class is dubious. You&#39;d come out of the class learning very little and many useless accounts in his lectures.He&#39;s an amazing lecturer. Because he&#39;s a clinical psychologist, he knows how to talk TO you, not AT you. Tells the funniest stories! He could be a little bit more organized and clear with what we need to know, but Segal is amazing!!No CommentsOne of the best lecturers I&#39;ve ever had. Very interesting material and an amazin teacher. Grading; not too hard...he&#39;ll make it easy on you if you study.A compassionate scatterbrain.  Hints of pretension, but that\u2019s relative.  He may be the most empathetic professor Cornell has, but is alas cursed with a capricious lecturing\/grading ethic.  Not to worry.  He\u2019ll make it easy on you.Prof. Segal is great! I looked forward to his lectures every day. Often tells stories and anecdotes to illustrate the point. I enjoyed his lectures so much that I went to office hours just to be able to talk to him.

He&#39;s very caring about his students and his lectures are interesting. Tests are fair and the final was actually incredibly fun. Another rater commented on email, it&#39;s much better to go to office hours, he gets a ton of emails and isn&#39;t quick to respond but he definitely cares!Harry is by far the best professor I&#39;ve had thus far at Cornell. He&#39;s funny, engaging, and his class teaches really interesting\/important material. There are a lot of readings, but if you get the general idea you&#39;ll be fine and he tells you what you need from the readings in lecture. Highly recommend if you are in any way interested in this class.Entertaining and fun class, going to lecture was the highlight of my day.  Yeah he doesn&#39;t really know the neuroscience and isn&#39;t totally organized...but still a great class.  He tells lots of anecdotes about patients which makes the material come to life.Wonderful person - funny, lively, intelligent, caring, and extremely helpful if you&#39;re interested in clinical psych. However, I didn&#39;t love his teaching style - lots of words packed onto slides that he blows through in between anecdotes\/rants and Hamlet performances - and his tests varied between joke questions and extremely nitpicky ones.its only the second week of class and is probably my favorite professor in four years. absolutely hilarious, able to inject humor into his lectures to keep things interesting. HIGHLY recommend prof and classThe class can be hard to get into for sophomores since it is so popular, but definitely take it if you can and if you have any interest in clinical psych or are premed. The workload is not bad, and he is such a fun, easy-going lecturer. A tad disorganized but he really cares about his students.Segal is by far the most inspiring prof I&#39;ve had at Cornell. His lectures are captivating, hilarious, and mind-blowing. Enjoyed every minute of his class, it felt more like free therapy. Segal is empathetic and accommodating and really wants his students to be healthy, happy, and successful. 100% recommend if you&#39;re at all interested in psych.Definitely one of my favorite professors\/classes at Cornell. Professor Segal is funny, interesting, and down-to-earth. The tests are fair and as long as you study you will do fine.by FAR my favorite professor at Cornell.  he is laid back, smart, direct, helpful, and really cares about his students. exams are fair and easy to do well on as long as you prepare. bonus: he usually makes his multiple choice questions have 1 choice that is clearly a joke, simultaneously making it easier and entertainingHarry Segal is AMAZING. There&#39;s a reason Adult Psychopathology fills up in less than 5 mins during CoursEnroll. He brings the material to life w\/ anecdotes about previous patients, etc., and soothes the class with his &#34;therapist voice.&#34; He&#39;s the same way in office hours, and truly cares about students. A little eccentric, but a great prof.Harry Segal is an absolute gem. Cares deeply about what he does and makes the material easy to understand. Don&#39;t bother doing the dense textbook readings (all available online) because Segal highlights in lecture what you actually need to know. Read the case studies. Listen when he talks Hamlet. Review lecture slides before exams. You&#39;ll do great!Harry Segal is the best professor that I&#39;ve had during my time at Cornell. He really makes the lecture material come to life and you can tell that he has the respect of everyone in the room. He genuinely cares about his students and I hope that I can take another class with him in the future. I&#39;ve recommended this class to all my friends!By far the best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell so far. I learned so much from him. The course challenges you to think about yourself and the people around you in a different way. Absolutely loved it, and him.He&#39;s sweet and makes the lectures really interesting. I really enjoyed this class.Amazing lecturer. He genuinely cares about his students and makes every lecture fun and the time fly by. Tests aren&#39;t bad as long as you actually do the readings! Even if you&#39;re not a psych\/human development major, you should definitely take this classA very good person who made the lectures entertaining and fun. Not much information covered in lecture but such a nice and genuine guy.So nice, truly cares about his students.  His lectures are usually funny, and relatiely interesting.  There is Hamlet in this class, which I personally don&#39;t like, but it is not too bad.  Overall he is a great professor!Harry&#39;s ability to tie anecdotes to subject matter is uncanny. Unfortunately he consumes too much time reading his own lecture slides and acting out scenes from Hamlet. As such, class was very hit-or-miss. Psychopathology was not the best psych course I&#39;ve taken, but it was still worthwhile.Segal is nice enough, but his lectures don&#39;t really have any substance. Him reading hundreds of words off slides and acting out Hamlet are annoying. But course is simple, only two prelims and final. Readings are fairly light and you can probably do well just by going to class and review sessions.

Expect a lot of work at the end. Interesting class with a great professor--lectures are never boring. Great class overall.Easily the most life-changing class I have ever taken. Professor Law is incredibly caring and wants each and every one of her students to engage with the material and succeed both inside and outside of class. Not an easy course (lots of reading and papers), but if you put in the work you will do well!Professor Law is a passionate professor and talented lecturer who cares deeply for both the course and the students taking it. This class is a lot of work but an easy A if you just do the work and demonstrate a genuine intellectual interest in the material. One of the most engaging courses I have taken at Cornell.Professor Law is amazing. This class was a lot of effort, but it was entirely worth it. Her lectures are very entertaining, and the field trips are a great way to break-up traditional classroom activities. Professor Law expects you to work hard, but she&#39;s so helpful when you put in effort.BEST. CLASS. EVER. Professor Law showed me how to look at my world in an entirely new light. I&#39;m a senior, and while I&#39;m really glad I got to take this class before graduation, I wish I had more time to take some of her other classes! Professor Law really creates an innovative, dynamic learning experience that you don&#39;t find very often! 10\/10This class stands out from many other classes that at Cornell in the most positive way. The lectures, field trips, films, guest lectures made this class a treasure to take and made learning the material a much more profound experience. Highly recommend!Everyone at Cornell should be required to take this class. Absolutely fantastic!This was the best course I&#39;ve ever taken. Professor Law brings the class together as a safe and loving community where students feel comfortable discussing the abstract and often heavy subject matter. The course offers learning at its finest, through exposure to new perspectives and paradigms of thought. I grew as a person through this class.Whether or not you care at all for religion or the Environment there&#39;s a lot beyond that one can pick up: how to communicate worldviews\/convictions to influence behavior, nuance our understanding of issues, and better relate to our thinking processes. You&#39;ll think across disciplines, learn esoteric facts and grow a conscience\/hope to save the worldProfessor Law is the best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell, and this class changed my life. The content of the course was difficult at times, but she was so supportive and helpful outside of class. She wants students to learn about how to live an intentional life through a study of religions, and it&#39;s amazing.Professor Law&#39;s Intro to Religion class was by far the best course I have ever taken.  No matter what your major is, taking a course with her will drastically increase the quality and thoughtfulness of your life.Dr. Law has honestly changed my college experience. She exposes you to so many new things in this class, and it is one of the very few courses that has truly made an impact upon me. Highly recommended to anyone who needs a distribution requirement. Be warned there are out of class field trips and many essays, but still completely, 100% worth it.","difficulty":3.0833333333,"rating":5.0},{"index":4649,"prof_name":"Ross Brann","prof_dept":"Near Eastern Studies","class_name":"RELST234","comment":"One of the few professors who can lecture without lots of fancy visual aids and powerpoint and still be totally interesting.

She&#39;s been great in every one of them. Discussions were thought-provoking and went whatever direction the students wanted - which led to some very interesting places. She&#39;s not a professor that has a list of things to get through and that you should notice about the readings. It&#39;s all very open-ended.The discussions were disorganized and hard to follow, but participation counted for a huge percentage of the grade, so I felt frustrated at times. Im not sure what I was supposed to learn from the class and I would not take another one with nancy. Boring overall, and the grading was very suspiciousProfessor Pollak is an incredible professor. She is very intelligent and is a clear expert in her field. She is really open to developing your ideas and conversations on particular thoughts can lead to creative and interesting places.

The material is mostly common sense, and everyone is just uninteresting.  Even Prof Cornwell seems to think its boring; he kept on talking about how he was excited for the last lecture to finish the class.  So if you need an easy class, you can take this, but I think there&#39;d be better options for an easy class.Prof Cornwell is a steady lecturer and covers some interesting stuff. And the class is pretty easy. Recommended.Great professor. The subject material was so interesting, and presented very clearly. The class isn&#39;t that hard; if you do the readings and go to lectures, you&#39;ll do well.the textbook was very good but everything else is useless.she was not very helpful. She&#39;s very unclear and harsh.Tori pushes her students to the point of no return (and she wears this reality with annoying pride). Despite learning a lot, you will never get the grade you deserve, (unless you are willing to drink her bath water).  I appreciated the challenge, but could have done without her lectures on water births and rising above her blue collar background.If you thought you work well in high-stress situations, this class is the ultimate test of your skills. Tori has serious power issues &amp; will yell at the class after asking for suggestions for improving the lectures (even the brightest are failing). Projects need more time to complete &amp; directions are unclear. Avoid this professor at all costs.Impossible to get an A, got a b minus and have never worked so hard in my lifeIf you&#39;re not interested in sociology, she&#39;s not interested in you. I was always very stressed when I had to talk to her and spent several hours rewording emails so she would not get angry at me. Felt like an arbitrary grader as well, since she gave almost no guidelines for her assignments.class was easy for a first year class. WE didnt take tests and she was a cool teacher. However there is a lot of readings but the homework isnt hard. Overall its a good classLoved the class - went only to see him ;) otherwise, when I skipped, the information was extremely easy to get from the slides and readings were not all that mandatory. Take the class! Definitely easy A.the class is hard and she is a very harsh grader. do not take this class unless you are sure you want to be a sociology majorawful professor. if you are not a sociology major, she will not be very helpful. she also plays favoritesThere is a lot of reading to do for homework and you don&#39;t use a text book so you have to print out all the articles which uses LOTS of paper and inc. Essays are kind of hard to understand and she doesnt give you very much feed back or any at all on the journals you have to do everyday so it&#39;s hard to know what grade you are getting.Long, repetitive class lectures; unmotivated class. Made me decide that Sociology is hardly even a legit field of study.Review sessions were very useful for the exams, other sessions were less useful but good for understanding the concepts better.For a 100 level class she made sure that we worked just as hard as any 300 level class. It was pretty much a guarantee that we wouldn&#39;t get a high grade and she turned a subject I had some interest into a department I wanted to avoid desperately.Amazing professor with a really clever sense of humor. Loved him. It helps that he&#39;s really cute, too.One of the best professors! Very passionate and energetic, seems like she really cares about students doing well. You don&#39;t really have to show up to get an A but I would def recommend going to lecture because shes really engaging. As long as u put a little bit of effort in, you&#39;ll get an ATori changed my life! She showed me a completely new way to see the world. She created a drive to learn Sociology. It&#39;s true that she isn&#39;t an easy grader but to get above a B in her class is a BIG deal because of this and you should feel proud of yourself. If you can make it with Tori, you can make it anywhere.Great professor and great class! He doesn&#39;t take attendance but he&#39;s interesting anyway so lectures are enjoyable. Homework is completely manageable (readings take only about a half hour most of the time). He spells out exactly what will be on the prelims, and he is very approachable and helpful. Take this class to relax and enjoy sociology!I LOVE BC! He is my ideal professor: easy, caring, subtle sense of humor, SO CUTE. Best addition to the Sociology department ever. I love how he has a dry wit. Welcome to Cornell, BC! Yay Soc 101, great class, take it!Erik is a great guy and is very intelligent. He will help you understand the material and has a dry sense of humor. I thought he was hysterical although it seems as if many of his jokes go above peoples&#39; heads.No Commentssweetheart of a guy, can&#39;t go wrong here. he is understanding and helpful ...  but do the readings, they are interesting.I personally feel threatened trying to talk to Tori when I have problems. She&#39;s intimidating and not very forgiving. I&#39;m not learning very much either -- 95% of it is material I learned five or more years ago. There&#39;s the occasional epiphany moment, but it&#39;s rare, and it&#39;s always during assigned reading, never in class.

Her sophistication and intelligence come across clearly in her highly articulate lectures, and she challenges you to engage with the sociological perspective to see the world in a different light. If she is teaching a class, TAKE IT. You will not regret it.Way too much active learning. Get ready to be in awkward and silent zoom breakout rooms for nearly half the lectures. Only take this class if you enjoy active learning and self study as most of what she wants you to know are in the readings and not in her actual teaching.She is nice but not a great professor. Nearly half of your grade 45% will be quizzes based on long readings. It was hard to remember the details of the readings for the quizzes especially because she does not go into depth with them in lecture. She IS going to test you on very specific information that she does not include in lectures. unfair imoIncredible professor. Easy class, definitely interesting material. Only 1 homework assignment per week. Don&#39;t bother reading the assignments, weekly memos take no effort. Prelims are incredibly easy.Prof. Garip teaches her class like we are a bunch of 12 year olds and the material is dryer than the Sahara. It&#39;s honestly the most basic presentation of sociology possible. One could learn more about the field through 10-20 minutes of Googling.Prof. Garip is an engaging and fair professor. She makes the topics and readings clear, simple, and accessible. Do the readings, show up to class (seriously helpful and attendance is mandatory), go to section (also very helpful), review notes before the exams, and you&#39;ll do well with relatively little extra effort.I loved Professor Garip. Even in a large lecture hall, her lectures always kept my attention and I truly looked forward to going to every class. My TA was great and we had fun discussions in section. There were weekly reading reflection assignments, but they were short (no longer than a page). The exams were doable, not too bad.Great lecturer and truly passionate about this field. She has a way of engaging the students, despite the class being a large lecture. She doesn&#39;t post her lectures online, however, and she can go a bit fast sometimes. Sections are pointless. Prelim grading is vague and her expectations aren&#39;t clear which is annoying. Still recommend.Gives the perfect amount of homework. Very vague about what you actually need to end up learning; studying for prelims becomes a guessing game.Filiz Garip is a good professor and she is passionate about sociology. That being said, SOC1101 is an intro course and I found it pretty boring since I was also taking upper level SOC classes at the same time. The material is easy and the exams come straight from the lecture slides.The readings were excessive. At least 80 pages of reading a week.She fails to address both sides of an issue, and I felt that I was being preached to by the Left. Grading is unpredictable, and studying requires too much memorization. If you like soc, take a higher level class with more interesting content. If you dislike soc, do NOT take this class - it&#39;s not an easy A (and premeds: it&#39;s not helpful for MCAT).Filiz is a fantastic professor. She clearly cares about the subject material, is enthusiastic and well-prepared for every lecture, and really appreciates input from students. She&#39;s down to earth and funny and also just seems like the sweetest person ever. Classes were lecture heavy - study them and you&#39;ll do fine. Fair &amp; I learned a lot. Love her!Professor Bischoff was great even in online lectures. The weekly quizzes required that you do the readings and pay attention in lecture but were not too difficult. The readings could be quite long but it really varied from week to week. Reflection papers were simple and graded very leniently as long as you answer the prompt.Although Professor Bogusz&#39;s class is challenging (he cold calls in class), I found it very rewarding. As a biology major, I was not too excited at the out set, but he really opened my eyes to the rigor and interesting nature of sociology. He was SUPER helpful in office hours. Overall a funny and engaging professor.Easy class, attended lecture maybe 5 times all semester, never did any readings.  study the lecture slides that he posts online and you&#39;re golden.  easy AGreat teacher with a good sense of humor. The class is pretty easy (know the slides, do the readings), but I actually enjoy his lectures.A peer advised me to take this course. Unfortunately, I found the lectures moderately interesting and the professor bordering rude. On one occasion the professor implied (to the entire class) that my question was more or less ridiculous.  I would not encourage anyone to enroll in this course unless sociology is a passion.Tideously boring at times but very easy. The subject was interesting but Cornwell&#39;s monotone &amp; nonchalant sense of humor didn&#39;t make it all too enjoyable. The material is easy to grasp if you find it the least bit interesting. Overall, good professor with a clear, sound understanding and presentation of his material.Warning: This class is not nearly as easy as people are saying.  I am a straight A student and the prelims are HARD, especially the later ones.  There are rumors that some group of people had all the answers to the test for the semester which artificially raised the averages...Definitely better than the typical intro course. Cornwell&#39;s lectures are clear and usually pretty interesting. If you just go to class and you&#39;ll be fine on the prelims. Wish I could take more soc classes.Cornwell is hilarious in a really reserved, subtle way. You have to watch for it. His lectures were definitely worth going to (this is coming from someone who skips most classes). There&#39;s a lot of reading to do, but it&#39;s all relevant, and you&#39;ll get a good grade if you just read. Sections were helpful for getting the &#34;big picture&#34; each week.Professor Cornwell is dryly funny, interesting, and pretty freakin&#39; adorable. He designed his own course packet and you can tell he really puts the work in. His TA&#39;s are a different story... Cross your fingers that you get one that can speak English.He&#39;s a good lecturer (and quite funny!!), so go to class! You don&#39;t have a textbook,but you have readings every week that you must do for section. His tests are alright,a mix of multiple choice, T\/F, and short answer. Questions can sometimes be tricky but if you study you&#39;ll be fine. The first 1\/3 of the course is a bit painful, but it gets better!Lectures are very clearly presented and there are no tricks on the exams. The readings in the course packet relate to topics in class and you&#39;ll be fine just knowing the main idea and how it relates to lecture notes, which he posts a few days prior to exams. There are a few written assignments throughout the semester and it is easy to do wellProfessor Cornwell is pretty cool. His lectures are interesting and you have to pay attention to catch his jokes. He&#39;s actually pretty funny. I never did the readings or paid attention in discussion, just went to lecture, took notes and I did fine.Lectures are very clear. Tests are also not too difficult. Material is pretty interesting too.Amazing professor. Lectures are very engaging. Offers lots of extra credit opportunities. Material is interesting and relevant. Lots of weekly reading which you have to summarize for a weekly homework response but easy to skim. Highly recommend Haskins, best professor I&#39;ve had at Cornell!Funny, super interesting, tests are straightforward.Bischoff is a professor. She&#39;s energetic, but that doesn&#39;t mean anything, since everything you learn is based on the readings. Lecture is useless. Section is useless. Her grading is terrible. In her own words, &#34;Getting the question right only means half credit. You need to really go beyond the question.&#34; Not even 2 pages on one question is an A.She&#39;s engaging and takes time to remember students&#39; names even in a large lecture. Her readings can sometimes be tough but she breaks it down in class. Lectures ARE important. Writing down what she says (not just copying her slides) as well as the examples that she gives helps for answering exam questions. Her exams are fair if you are attentive.This professor is so helpful.  I was a math &amp; physics major coming in his class and he made sociology interesting.  I&#39;m not a humanities guy but he made me like sociology.  And if you put in a lot of effort, he rounds people up, like he did to me.  He can probably tell who wrote this, but I have to give him respect.  He is the man, take him.Ben Cornwell is awesome. SOC 1101 is manageable. Exams (prelims + non cumulative final) are straightforward - just do ALL readings before and have the gist of the readings down, and you&#39;ll be fine. Pay close attention to lecture material, as well. He&#39;s an awesome professor though.At the beginning of the semester, we were told that every test would be purely memorization, and doing so would easily get you an A+. Come the second test, there was very unfair and ambiguous grading over simple word choices. Professor rushes through the material at the beginning of class and tries to hold discussions that don&#39;t really help at all.The kind of professor that will learn your name if you speak up often, even in a huge class. She is an engaging lecturer and she explains all of the reading in a very comprehensible way. She gives lots of extra credit opportunities and doesn&#39;t give homework or have class the week of a prelim. Overall, a very pleasant person to take a class from.Professor Bischoff is an amazing professor! She gives interesting and easy to follow lectures that are very engaging. Definitely an easy A if you put in the time for the readings, which I found to be mostly interesting anyways (there were only a few really long\/dense ones). Made me consider double majoring in sociology. Take this class if you can!!Great professor! He is very knowledgeable in the subject matter, easily approachable and a very friendly guy. Attendance is not required, he posts slides right before exams; do most of the readings and go to section (there is a section grade) and you&#39;ll be set. Two prelims and a final (which is non-cumulative), plus extra credit available. Easy A!This class is so much better than DSOC 1101. Haskins is much more interesting to listen to, and the course structure is better (25% each exam\/15% sections\/10% memos). The readings are so long but they are summarized in lecture, and study guides are provided for exams. The only complaint I have is that the section is useless but attendance is taken.TAKE HER CLASSES! Filiz is amazing- maybe the best professor I have had at Cornell. She cares SO much about her students. Her lectures are well-prepared and engaging, and she has a great sense of humor! Not only is she a great lecturer, she also has an amazing mind and academic pedigree: PhD from Princeton, and worked at Harvard before Cornell!This class is perfect if you&#39;re looking for an easy A, but I personally didn&#39;t get much out of it. Haskins simply read out definitions without truly applying them to current events or real world issues. Grading on prelim 2 was harsh and arbitrary; points were deducted for not having a word by word definition of concepts they didn&#39;t ask for.Mixed feelings about the course. Lectures were pretty straightforward (material got somewhat confusing towards the end). I liked that the prelims were all short answer, however, they were pure memorization. As stated by others, prelim 2 was graded harsh, but I think prelim 1 + 3 were more lax. Generous extra credit! Sections were totally useless.Paul is hands down the best TA I&#39;ve ever had and I&#39;m going to miss him so much. His powerpoints were always on point and I genuinely looked forward to going to his section every week. He inspired me to continue taking Sociology classes despite being a Bio major, and he definitely deserves a hot tamale on this website.Don&#39;t take this class if you are trying to learn anything. Prof was nice but the content was terriblepainfully simple and in some cases not even updated with modern widely accepted research. Memorizing will get you in the A range easily.This class is easy if you show up sometimes and take good notes outside of the slides. You don&#39;t have to do the readings to get an A because she goes over them. She is super sweet, knowledgable, and tries to get to know everyone. The memos are easy 100s: pick one sentence or point made in the reading and connect it to your everyday life.Especially for an online class, lectures were very engaging! Professor Bischoff explains concepts well and incorporated fun aspects like group polls and videos into class.Lecture felt more like a middle school course than a college course. She read out definitions in class, we mindlessly copied from a powerpoint and regurgitated definitions verbatim on exams. Discussions were useless and &#34;active learning&#34; wasted lecture time. Easy class but I didn&#39;t gain much memorizing convoluted definitions I didn&#39;t understand.Loved this class! Prof. Bischoff explained the concepts in a straightforward manner, since the majority of the students are not going to become sociology majors. Tests were only short answers, and the TAs look for precise, word-for-word answers when grading, so a bit of general memorization is helpful. Discussion sections on Fridays were mandatoryLoved her, her lecture were extremely helpful so I never did any of the readings. Weekly memos are easy as long as you apply your experience outside of class to the course material. She&#39;s extremely approachable and understanding. Overall, really enjoyed her class and will be taking SOC2220 with her this fall!For the exams write everything you know about the topic theyre asking about. They grade exams by giving you points if they see a word or phrase or example theyre looking for, so write a lot, more doesnt hurt.It&#39;s a fairly easy A (but not easy A+) course as long as you memorize well (her ppt) before the exams. I would say Prof. Garip is passionate about her subject, and the content does cover the basics of sociology. The readings are usually long and heavy, but those aren&#39;t mandatory. The class median was A in sp19.Had him his first semester here-- really helpful and spells out what he wants you to know.  He&#39;s adorable.Very engaging TA. He knows what he&#39;s talking about and makes the subject matter relevant and interesting to you.Not a big fan of her class. I knew all the material but somehow didn&#39;t do so hot on the prelims. Turns out you have to write exactly what she wants you to write or else it&#39;s wrong. Not a big fan of forced memorization over real learning and understanding.She is a really nice professor, and she really wants us to learn more about critical thinking, while this class per se does not require that much effort to do well. A great relaxation if you have tons of work from other classes. Does not curve. SShe is a very knowledgeable professor who takes the pretty straightforward subject matter and delves deep. You can skip every class and still get an A on the prelims (she posts slides online), but if you go you will get a great understanding. She will make an effort to learn your name and the weekly homework is abundant but easy. Would take again!","difficulty":2.2727272727,"rating":3.9272727273},{"index":4723,"prof_name":"Anna Haskins","prof_dept":"Sociology","class_name":"SOC1110","comment":"I LOVED Professor Haskins!

Keep up with the readings and avoid last minute studying as there is a lot of material. Going to class really helps. Definitely an interesting lower level class.Excellent professor. Keeps the class engaged throughout. Going to class means studying is minimal, with only the relevant papers to read.\n Excellent teacher, and excellent class.Actually, this semester you have to take 2 prelims\/a final. She gives you about 8 possible essay questions ahead of time, but this means you have to prepare 8 detailed outlines, then remember them. Exhausting! I&#39;m doing well in the class, but the prelim studying is terrible. Also,the TA fails at life\/is in charge of grading. Weeden is great though!LOVE her- so funny and amazing, great classShe is a horrible lecturer who reads directly from the slides with far too much text.  She should just hand out notes and tell her students to memorize them the night before the test to do well.  Don&#39;t take this class.This class is enjoyable, interesting and not that hard.  The lecture notes are all online, so there really is no reason to attend class.  The course reader (the one book for the class) is big, but don&#39;t be scared.  All the reading need only be skimmed before the exams, which are also not that hard.This class is amazing. And she is a great lecturer as well. Grading is fair, and you will do well so long as you prepare for the exams.Don&#39;t need to do the readings at all just go to class and the review sessions, and with some studying you&#39;ll be fine.

Overall, he does really want to see you succeed.Prof. Nee&#39;s class is a great intro to sociology, and you don&#39;t need any prior knowledge. He loves his work and connects the big ideas to examples at Cornell, which is helpful. Not the most engaging discussion leader and the readings can be a bit dry.

The class is extremely useful and highly applicable to any path in life. Grading was fair and reasonable. Follow along in class and interact with the ideas, and you will do well. The class is definitely worthwhile and highly recommended.Nee is an incredibly nice guy who loves what he&#39;s teaching and wants kids to do well. That being said, the material is pretty dry and some of the readings can be confusing. Section is VERY important. Prelims are both essays and you have to do the readings to do well. Yet despite all that, he bumps up the grades and its really not hard to get an A.Easy A if you follow lectures and skim through readings.

Puts two on the exam and you choose one. She goes through the complex lectures REALLY fast and there is no takenote. Review sessions dont help much. She tricks you by saying she posts notes online but purposely deletes all the key concepts from the blackboard version so u&#39;ll come to class.You dont have to do the readings as long as you go to class. She gives you the essay questions before the exam. I suggest taking the class with a group of friends and writing the essays before the exams.One of the best lecturers at cornell (not one of the best *teachers*, though). Her tests allow you to select 1 of 2 essay questions from a pool of 5-7 she supplies ahead of time. DL the class notes, skim the readings, make &amp; memorize essay outlines, and you&#39;re golden. But actually going to lecture is recommended; she&#39;s very engaging.Professor Weeden is an extremely engaging lecturer, but I found the class to be poorly structured. We only met twice a week and no other examination was given other than the 3-4 prelims. Due to this, I found myself often slacking and putting other classes before this one. She assigns a lot of readings, but you can get by without doing most.Kim is a really nice professor, she sympathizes with students which is evident from the fact that she lets you take 3 out of 4 exams and gives you the test questions in advance (5-6 of them, then 2 are on the exam, you choose 1). She&#39;s one of those people you want to be friends with. I&#39;d take the class if it fulfills a requirement for sure.Professor Weeden is incredible. She is engaging, thorough, funny, as nice as can be. I HIGHLY recommend taking this class, especially if it fulfills a requirement. The material taught is tremendously important and relevant, and this course will make you a more informed citizen. See previous ratings for the grading policy; it&#39;s more than fair.Following an early comment, Kim is an excellent lecturer, but not the best *teacher.* She is tremendously engaging and a clear expert but she provides MANY explanations for phenomena and blows through them quickly which makes retaining material much more difficult. For exams, you&#39;re basically expected to know everything she talked about + readings.Weeden is HILARIOUS. She manages to get her point across while keeping the lecture light. Her exams are essay-based, so she will give you 5-7 essay prompts in advance, 2 will be on the exam, and you write one of the 2. If you pre-write and incorporate both lecture and readings you will do fine. Amazing class-would take again!Her preparatory essay questions are horrible.

Everyone should take a class with Professor Haskins before they graduate.Professor Haskins is a great professor who really gets you to focus on the bigger picture. She assigns a good amount of reading but it&#39;s all worth it and she goes over it in lecture. Her exams are graded well and she wants to make sure you understand patterns more than numbers. It&#39;s a great class and is making me consider a major change! It&#39;s an interesting and enjoyable class, but kinda hard. If you don&#39;t write what they&#39;re looking for on the tests, then you won&#39;t do well. Plentyyy of extra credit seminars (and they&#39;re interesting!). Overall good class. Discussions were pointless even though they&#39;re mandatory. Haskins is super nice and truly does care about the students.Prof Haskins is a great *teacher* who cares that students understand the fundamentals about inequality. She does a good job of not forcing students to be bogged down by minutia in her exams. Understand the basic ideas of readings and the points of her lectures, and you should be fine. Debates were also enjoyablenot stressful. Overall, great class.Anna Haskins is my favorite professor at Cornell! SOC2220 was a joy to be in.

I did the most work in this class than I did in all my other classes. I&#39;m glad I took this class; very relevant.Impossible to figure out how class is structured. Avoid.I like Sassler.  She&#39;s friendly - and not just professor-friendly either - and fair.  I wouldn&#39;t impugn her teaching skills by any stretch.  Lectures were organized, complete, thoughtful, and almost always engrossing.  The tests were multiple choice-heavy, which was disappointing.  But it&#39;s an undergrad PAM class; what else can you expect?Sassler is very accommodating and understanding of student life. She is funny and lectures are worthwhile but not mandatory. She essentially gives you the prompts to the essay questions on exams.

Highly recommended!Highly recommended!Dr. Bischoff is why I am considering changing my study path from art to sociology in grad school. I took 2 classes from her; both were wonderful, informative, and inspirational. She encourages everyone to speak about their (relevant) opinions without judgment, and goes above and beyond to help students understand class materials AND their passions.Take this class, you will be happy you did. Professor Bischoff is knowledgeable and approachable, making her a great professor.She&#39;s young and has fresh energy which isn&#39;t too common in the soc. department. She has good research credentials and assigns informative readings although some might be a bit advanced if you&#39;ve never had soc before. You will NEED to study for the exams thoroughly but you can really take a lot from her courses. Speak up in class, too!Needs better memes but best TA I&#39;ve ever had. He won&#39;t be afraid to call you out on your bs in your papers because he knows how to take an argument apart logically and can tell when something was done in a rush. Having said that, he will drastically improve your writing and is very knowledgable overall.puts in more effort than he needs to, so if you don&#39;t take his critiques (you will get many, be ready) constructively and don&#39;t take advantage of the time he willing to put in to help you, it&#39;s your loss. he acknowledges effort, and if you put in the work, you should be fine.Paul is truly invested in his students. While at first I was upset by some of the grades I received, I did steadily improve throughout the semester. Don&#39;t be discouraged by his criticism, he is only saying things to help!Excellent class.","difficulty":3.6666666667,"rating":4.7777777778},{"index":4761,"prof_name":"Christine Leuenberger-Pinch","prof_dept":"Sociology","class_name":"SOC352STS354","comment":"The class was all over the place.

She&#39;s from Spain, living in america, yet claims america sucks- really frustrating and demeaning if you try to discuss things she doesn&#39;t agree with- half the time she&#39;s wrong anyways. like the one time she said that rightists and materialistic people were the same b\/c all republicans just want money. :(Agree with her ideology to get a good grade. What happened to &#34;ANY PERSON any study?&#34; She dislikes wealthy people and\/or americans. The whole class is about white americans discriminating against hispanics.

There was a lot of homework (readings, online problems, etc.) that needed to be done every night before class. No single assignment determines the grade, it depends on consistent performance throughout the semester.I cannot speak enough to how impressed I was with him as a professor and as a person. He lives and breathes to serve the needs of the students.  He pushed everyone to their limit to improve their Spanish more and focused on what each one of us needed to do that. Other professors could do with a page from his book!In my third semester of language, I was very upset to see unrealistic expectations for homework, which ended up being well beyond what was outlined for the course. As a senior taking high level major courses, this course ruined my ability to balance graduate-level and 3000-level major courses. Switch sections if you can.He made sure everyone in the class was involved in the lessons and contributed to discussions everyday.  He continually helped me improve my reading, writing and speaking skills in Spanish. I felt like every time I talked in class I learned something new from the feedback he gave. His mastery of Spanish and English is incredible.He creates such a calm atmosphere. I used to stress greatly before every class (in my previous classes), but el Profe creates such a positive learning environment in the classroom that you always feel encouraged to participate wo having to be worried. He never puts anyone down. He creates a very open environment and always gets everybody to get out of their comfort zone and participate. Truly charismatic, active and observant. El profe is very clear in his expectations and very, very helpful in getting us to achieve them. It is by far my favorite class at Cornell!Great professor! Very knowledgeable, kind, patient &amp; enthusiastic. The way he explains each and every concept and answers all questions is excellent. Well structured class. The course material is covered in an efficient, clear and speedy manner. Were not even halfway through the semester and Ive learned tons and my Spanish has improved by leaps!!Silvia has been one of my favorite professors at Cornell so far. She is very patient, and makes Spanish fun! I learned way more with her in one semester of Spanish than I did in 5 semesters of high school Spanish. I would definitely recommend her and her class.An amazing professor. I love his quirkiness and sense of humor :)He maintains a stimulating environment to learn language organically where the students want to engage in class and where reaching beyond ones comfort zone is encouraged. He is always so respectful. Never taunts or picks on anyone. I had never had an instructor so well prepared and so dedicated to helping his students learn!Best Spanish teacher I&#39;ve had at Cornell. She&#39;s pretty strict on the Spanish-only policy, which is good I think. Gives feedback on rough drafts for every essay. Class activities are generally pretty interesting. She was very helpful in office hours.Unbelievably organized. Always gave us meaningful work. Each activity he prepares is so engaging and moves from one to the next seamlessly. Always explained things in a way I could understand and kept an almost constant conversation flowing. Side note: uber chic dresser!He teaches through some of the most comprehensive and well put together  lessons I have ever seen and he is one of the most professional and well put together teachers I have ever had. Vastly knowledgeable in the field and never does anything without a reason for doing so.By far, one of the best professors I&#39;ve ever had. His classes are definitely a lot of work - at least 1.5 hr per night. But classes are always engaging because he uses a variety of teaching methods (lecture, discussion, small group activities) and the discussion topics are interesting.  He also gives lots of opportunities to improve your grade.Very interested in helping students! Not moody, but honest and approachable.She expects perfection in class for intermediate to below non-native Spanish speakers.I&#39;m in a class she coordinates. I like the person who teaches me, but not the coordinator who creates the syllabus. The work that this crazy lady makes us do is just absurd. I probably learned much more with other better professors who actually engages us in Spanish, not just drown us with useless works.Phenomenal... stellar professor! Never in my life I saw so much commitment to a job. I have never had a teacher like him before so dedicated and selfless, and I am now so glad I took his class.  I wish all the teachers at Cornell cared as much as he does. The amount of personal attention he gives you is tremendous. He&#39;s very knowledgeable about all topics, takes great interest in what  he is teaching and pays attention to his students. I got an A, but he really made me work for ti.  No regrets at all though!  There are tons of opportunities to succeed through meaningful and challenging assignments, not just tests.If you do all the work and go to every class, you&#39;ll be fine. Just don&#39;t expect As on writing assignments unless your grammar is perfect.Interesting, challenging, fun, understanding, but most of all relevant! I am currently on vacation in Costa Rica and I have been able to communicate with the locals and participate in all kinds of conversations. The feeling is amazing! Before taking his class I could only mumble a few words and phrases in Spanish.Silvia is SO nice. She is super friendly, personable, and welcoming - I always felt comfortable. I always got the feeling that she really wants us to learn Spanish properly. I do have to say that it isn&#39;t an easy course. She is really tough in the essays, it&#39;s pretty impossible to get an A, BUT I cannot believe how much my Spanish improved.He not only gives a cultured view of the language but knows the logistics (all the ins and outs) of Spanish grammar and knows how to explain it effectively as well. He makes speaking easier without being nervous or embarrassed and is so engaging!I had Emilia for SPAN 1230 and I thought she explained grammar well and was clear on grading. Her english wasn&#39;t the best, so it was difficult when she tried to explain things in english, but I think my Spanish definitely improved! The class is very textbook heavy which is frustrating since it was expensive thoughI took this class last semester and wasn&#39;t doing too well so i dropped it. I retook it with professor Oritz and i couldn&#39;t have been happier. The class is somewhat hard, but he has no control over it, the dept. does. He does however help out when he can. Hes so friendly, it was a pleasure to be in his class.Perhaps the best teacher I&#39;ve had at Cornell.  Really cares about his students and puts his time and effort into helping them learn and is a great guy in general.   1010 as a teacher and more importantly, a human beingHe&#39;s a cool guy in and outside of the classroom. Be ready to speak in Spanish a lot because he stresses that, something you should be grateful for considering the next Spanish classes are even more strict. His assignments are pretty straightforward and writing is simple. As long as you go to class and at least skim the homework, you&#39;ll be fine.Very unexperienced and moody at timesDiego is such a great teacher, I had to take spanish as a requirement and Diego made it manageable. The course itself has a lot of work but Diego is a fantastic teacher with a good sense of humor who really cares about his students in addition to being a really nice guy. Would highly recommend him as a professor.nice person and very energetic and tries to help. crazy about grammar. sometimes idk what she was taking points off for. is not forgiving if you don&#39;t have oral presentations perfect. make sure you participate a lot in classHe is an amazing professor!

He genuinely cares about improving your Spanish but more importantly cares about you as a person. He is very charismatic and has a great sense of humor. Take his class.He&#39;s the best. If you can have him as a professor, pick him over another option.While she is a good professor, it is obvious that teaching is not her main focus. She is too busy to answer emails and unwilling to offer help outside of class. Don&#39;t be fooled by her seemingly warm personality.Diego was great! Language classes are a lot of work no matter what, but Diego is a fair grader and assigned interesting work. 4 written exams, 2 oral exams,  4 short papers, 1 &#34;dramita,&#34; and a final video project, but no final exam. Daily homework, but it&#39;s totally doable and he really wants to help students learn.I came into this class hating Spanish, and I now love Spanish, so I guess that goes to show what a great professor Diego is. He will make you do the work to understand Spanish, but I think at the end of the day he wants everyone to do well in his class and go on to actually use their Spanish.

ASra. Redmond did a great job making tough material and a somewhat dry\/grammatical course interactive, inclusive, and hands-on. There are a lot of assignments- quizzes, homework, group projects, etc., but I found that helpful with raising my grade from pretty low test scores. She&#39;s a tough grader but willing to explain everything\/is easy to reach.I love him! The man is awesome, definitely one of the best teachers of Spanish I&#39;ve ever had. His speaking is clear and understandable. He is more than willing to help during office hours or set something extra up with you.He is very knowledgeable and experienced and loves his students. His sense of humor is great. You&#39;ll be lucky to have him!Unbelievably awesome.Daniel is the man. Super chill, great sense of humor and informal style of teaching. Doesn&#39;t make you feel too pressured when you&#39;re talking, which is good because talking in class is definitely emphasized. Have to study on your own a lot for the tests but he makes class as fun as it could be.He is really involved in class and gets everyone to talk a lot.  He is an incredibly interesting and extremely passionate person. He loves to teach and does it extremely well. Always helps you in areas you are having trouble with and works with you to find the best solution.I really enjoyed having Andy for SPAN 2090. He did a good job making it easy to participate in class and gave good feedback on Spanish skills.I just took Spanish to fill my Arts requirement but Monica is one of the best teachers I&#39;ve ever had. She really made me love the language and I came out feeling like I had learned it, even though it was tough.he is very smart, very organized, also strict but kind and understanding.  Gives very helpful feedback on essays. he doesn&#39;t nit-pick but doesn&#39;t let outrageous mistakes slide. Always puts much effort to prepare materials and activities that can intrigue students&#39; interest.Great Professor! Very interesting and insightful. Makes everyone feel comfortable and makes discussions quite fun.Silvia was my favorite professor this semester. She&#39;s caring, reasonable, and highly encouraging. The class was definitely a lot of work at times, but it was always manageable and within reason-- your Spanish WILL improve. I initially took the class just to fulfill the language req, but now I&#39;ve been inspired to continue Spanish throughout college.:)Hands down the best professor I have met at this school. Not only will you learn spanish, but you will also be able to discuss ethics and morality as part of his class. That being said, it is a lot of work, but if you put in effort you will come out with at least a B. A is usually reserved for the very hard workers.One of the best teachers that I have had. He made Spanish fun and enjoyable. I thoroughly enjoyed this class and he is very reasonable with grading. There is a lot of work, but he will work with you to make it easier to handleDiego is probably my favorite Spanish teacher of all time. Smart, astute, and very prepared, he was fun and approachable and helped me out when I was behind with injuries and sickness. Highly recommend.She&#39;s really great. Her class is really interesting. As long as you do the work you&#39;ll get good gradesShe is really nice and willing to help. She is a very hard grader on the compositions and group assignments. There is a lot of busy work but that is for Span 2090 in general not just this class. Class attendance and participation is required which is normal as the class is capped at 16. The small class size facilitates interpersonal dialogue, and Silvia is AMAZING. She is caring and wants her students to succeed at Cornell and in her class. I definitely think Silvia&#39;s great teaching would allow any motivated student to succeed. Does a virtual exchange with students in Colombia, which was a great experience. Lovely person.She is an excellent professor. If you go to office hours, she is so helpful. She teaches a lot of little nuances that make a huge difference in Spanish writing and speaking. Her positive and funny attitude makes the class fun and interesting. I hope all my Spanish professors are like her.She does not give the positive feedback that is necessary for a mid-level language class. Instead of encouraging students to speak and building their confidence with their oral skills, she focuses on the one gramatical thing they get wrong, resulting in a lot of kids remaining quiet and never volunteering for fear of getting shut down. I was intimidated by these ratings but IRL, Silvia is great. After months without practice, she refined my Spanish and empowered me so much. Make use of office hours and make sure she gets to know you. Her feedback is super helpful on ensayos and she will go over your test errors personally. Silvia made online learning feel more doable!!!The textbook is used heavily, and tests are hard, but neither is her fault. She helps you as much as you need it, and facilitates the class well. She will give you breaks in the form of good grades on projects if your grades are lacking in other areas.  Overall, a good, caring prof. Would recommend.I was initially very intimidated by the syllabus and considered dropping the class, but she encouraged me to stay and I am so glad I did. She is the best Spanish professor I have ever had, and I learned so much more from her in just one semester than I did in all my years of high school Spanish. And she returns things promptly. Amazing professor!!The content of this class was not difficult coming out of AP Span in high school, the challenge was the workload. The class meets 3x per week, and there is at the minimum 2-3 hours of HW due the following class every single class. However, if you are struggling, she is sooo accessible in office hours and will genuinely try to help you succeed!Silvia will make you work for your grade, but you will inevitably get what you put into the class. I started off really lazy and my grades reflected it, but she gave me a nudge and knew I could do better so I picked it up towards the end of the semester and my grade improved. She&#39;s a little contradictory sometimes with what she expects in homework.Professor is a solid OK. Definitely not entertaining but bearable. A ton of busy work. Attendance is mandatory. Easy A, especially if you took AP Spanish.","difficulty":3.1153846154,"rating":4.5384615385},{"index":4797,"prof_name":"Brisa Teutli","prof_dept":"Languages","class_name":"SPAN2095","comment":"Excellent!!!

She cares a lot about her students, so put in the work and you&#39;ll get good results!Silvia isn&#39;t a good professor. She has single-handedly ruined my passion for Spanish. Every class of hers feels like torture. She is a super tough grader and expects you to talk, speak, read, and write like a fluent native speaker.

She is a professor you will look back on 30 years from now and remember what she taught you.One of the best professors I had. She is easy to approach and class with her is very enjoyable!Crazy woman. Loves to say: &#34;I&#39;m very, very good at what I do.&#34; Unfortunately, if that were true, everyone would know it and she wouldn&#39;t have to say it all the time. Her class is not that hard if you are on her good side.Simone took a class on a period of literature that has the potential to be really boring and makes it interesting and relatable. We even did trips to the Johnson museum and Rare Books library to look at manuscripts from the time period we were studying and art from that period. Very fair grading and overall a very good class.The Spanish Golden Age is one of the most fascinating periods in literature. Simone, however, manages to bring to life the worst aspects of this period, as you feel that you are experiencing Cervantes&#39; struggle--being kidnapped and hoping desperately that someone rescues you. In the end, it is not Simone&#39;s fault that she isn&#39;t professor material.Simone takes Spanish Golden Age literature and introduces new and unexpected ways to view and interpret the texts. She understands the fact that this is only a survey course and doesn&#39;t expect gratuitous analysis of literary minutiae. Instead, she sets the groundwork for a working knowledge and appreciation of the texts covered in class.Simone, aside from having written five books in different languages, is a passionate and caring professor. I love her and her classes!Lectures aren&#39;t interactive as Simone only wants her favorites to talk in class even when they say things that lack basic analysis. Essays are fine and quite short in general. Simone does take attendance in every class, though.She&#39;s an amazing teacher who is beyond nice and laid back. Of course, you need to try to some degree and a clear comprehension of Spanish is required. However, she makes the course enjoyable regardless of your skill level.Professor was out of control.

If you participate, don&#39;t miss class, and care, you will do well. Fair grader. Highly respected.Genuinely cares about students and takes time to meet with them outside of class. Passionate about her subject. Somewhat disorganized and gives instructions that are often confusing. Can be hard to figure out what she expects from students on the assignments.I absolutely loved having Cecilia as a professor.  She is quite scatterbrained but she is so passionate about what she is teaching and she really does care about students.  My writing improved incredibly this semester, not just in Spanish but in English too.  I&#39;m hoping to take a class of hers next semester, too.  Absolutely incredible. She definitely makes you work for the class, but she often allows late work, gives extra credit, and gives meaningful feedback. Plus, she&#39;s always enthusiastic about class discussion, she&#39;ll genuinely care about you (if you put effort in), and her assignments are very open and thought-provoking. I wish she taught above 2180!!My Spanish really improved in Cecilia&#39;s class.  For introductory level courses, I&#39;d imagine she&#39;s a bit overwhelming, but if you&#39;re a Spanish Major\/Minor, you already have a passion for the language and would enjoy her class.She&#39;s nice and flexible about deadlines, and her grading isn&#39;t bad. The papers themselves are short and easy, but there is a lot of reading for a &#34;writing workshop.&#34; Her instructions are often confusing\/unclear, and it feels like she imposes her own perspective of the readings onto us, so any conclusions we make about them are heavily guided.Amazing class and amazing lecturerOne of the most inspiring, funny, and passionate professors I&#39;ve ever had!

This said, he was always well-prepared and engaging, very thorough, knowledgeable and extremely down-to-earth and challenged us to always think critically and be more aware and accepting of marginalized groups.He&#39;s a decent professor.

He is a great guy and he really went out of the way to get to know every student so that he could better help them learn. He grades fairly, but the homeworks can be tedious and time-consuming.  He understands that the grammar is boring, but he makes it enjoyable.

She is inflexible (forced me to take a zero instead of moving a quiz when I could not be in town due to an interview, for example). She also claims there to be particularly correct analysis for any given piece of literature -- an obvious falsehood. Avoid.She is awesome.

Show up to lectures and discussion for participation, which is a big part of your grade. 3 easy quizzes are the only sit-downs you&#39;ll take. 2 papers take the place of prelims and finals. As long as you write them semi-coherently, you&#39;ll get A&#39;s. Hilgartner is a dynamic lecturer and a great guy.I don&#39;t really write reviews, but Prof Slayton is someone that deserves the recognition for her work and care for her students. Readings can be technical, but she really breaks them down to help you understand. Can get kind of boring, but the concepts are still interesting. Grading is very clear, and she gives A LOT of help and feedback on essays.Professor Slayton is great! Her slides are detailed and informative. Her quizzes are very fair and she tells you exactly what she expects, and everything comes from the slides. The readings were a little challenging, but before quizzes, she reviews concepts from them that she wants you to know. Her paper assignments are graded fairly as well.Great course that encouraged thinking and discussion on the role of science and technology in society. He uploaded fun and engaging lecture videos each week in the online course. There were many papers but they were easy to write and we got timely feedback on how to improve from him and his TAs. Would take again for another course.","difficulty":2.0,"rating":4.75},{"index":4882,"prof_name":"Stephen Hilgartner","prof_dept":"Science","class_name":"STS201E","comment":"No Comments","difficulty":2,"rating":5},{"index":4883,"prof_name":"Kathleen Vogel","prof_dept":"Social Science","class_name":"STS205","comment":"Amazingly boring...defied the laws of nature in terms of how boring she could make a lecture.

Velleman is excellent professor, perhaps the best I&#39;ve had so far at Cornell. I had no experience with Statistics before his class, but his lectures and textbook were so clear. You can tell that he knows his concepts inside out and he&#39;s great at explaining them. I strongly recommend him.Great guy, conveyed a lot of passion about the subject, and gave a great intro to statistics. He really understands what he is teaching and to whom, and the class is well structured, even though there was some confusion about the textbooks\/DVDs. He was also very democratic as to grading exams, removing confusing questions post-exam.Very clear lecturer, excited about statistics. Does have an ego but you don&#39;t interact with him much anyway. If you study and practice with the questions at the end of the chapters, you&#39;ll do well on the exams. Put in the work and you&#39;ll learn Stats. I understand the subject so much better now. Take this class, you won&#39;t regret it.Packard is a good professor. Class notes are useful and clear. Sometimes it can be easy to get lost during lecture, but as long as you read the textbook, go to discussions, and do practice questions for the exam, you will succeed! His tests ask for a little more than what is taught in class. He is a little dorky but in a very endearing way!Don&#39;t know why people said it&#39;s dry and hard. For me the class is really organized and easy for reviewing and he provided detailed but organized note for every lecture. You could bring cheat sheet for prelim and definition and formula would help a lot in the exam. You would find the Professor really nice and willing to answer questions on Piazza.Karns is a good professor, beware of the participation requirements for section and iclickers. She tries her best to make sure that a huge lecture hall of students is set up for success and does explain things in fairly simple terms.

She is also very caring and approachable, and one of the few professors I&#39;ve been able to become friends with outside of class!Dr. Smith is a real gem of a professor. She takes the time to get to know her students, and is passionate about her subject. She really goes the distance to make sure Stats is easily graspable, and there is never a dull lecture. She is one of the best professors I have had here at Cornell, and I recommend her fully.Dr. Smith uses lots of real life examples or experiments to explain the material, and she teaches better than the textbook. There are lots of opportunities to practice newly learned material in class. She is funny, engaging, and even memorizes all her student&#39;s names. She also gives out extra credit (as long as you attend the lectures).If you&#39;ve taken stats before, this class will be a breeze, but if you haven&#39;t, prof Smith will guide you through it every step of the way. She really cares about each student, and takes the time to get to know you personally during class. Lectures can be a bit disorganized at times, but you WILL understand the material by the time the exam comes.She&#39;s very sweet and really tries to get to know her students. I am not a huge fan of math classes, but she made this class very engaging. Her lectures are clear, and she explains concepts very well. Her exams are challenging but fair, and she gives us a lot of information about them and tons of practice. Love her!Amazing person and teacherVery boring and uninspiring. Lecture content is disorganized. Difficult to learn.

Lab times weren&#39;t that useful but I went to a lot of office hours with UTAs and they were super helpful.Great prof! Very caring and tries to make the class as fun as possible. She prepared us well for exams, and I really ended up learning a lot. She&#39;s also very easy to talk to, and really tries to help us with our questions.Dr. Smith is one of the few professors who are willing to get up close and personal with her students. Her class is VERY interactive and as enjoyable as a stats class can be. Exams are very fair and manageable. Going to lab is VERY useful for completing the problem sets, as TAs give pointers\/answer questions on how to go about problems\/R code.my best friend. well at least i feel like it. she actually tries to learn names which is cool. tbh i would listen to her podcast if she had one. shes a great speaker and good at explaining difficult topics. very engaging in class participation.Really amazing professor.

The only good is that its&#39; a free-frag 500-level course.This professor definitely is not nice to the students. Would not let students take prelims early, curves the class ridiculously low, and just provides vague answers to any question you ask. Also makes ppt presentations with 80\/90 slides. We were def. taught something different in engineering communications.The class is not curved.  A lot of students I know from Cornell get A&#39;s.

After he knew that I am located in Europe and the evening office hours would be too late for me, he immediately added afternoon office hours to accommodate my schedule. The class is not so easy as some told me, but Professor You is always helping outside classroom making learning much easier.Interesting professor and innovative teaching style. The assignment of developing a wiki is quite unique. I am fond of his course!Great professor, interesting topics, fair grading, abundant office hours and helpful TAs. A five-star course!Professor clearly has a strong background in the content and a lot of knowledge. He creates good examples in the lectures that show how to implement the algorithms we learned about. Professor You is the best!I am very appreciative to Prof You. He is a great professor and even a great person!5 stars professor and 5 stars course by all means. Excellent content, excellent teaching, excellent organization and up to date knowledge and material.Workload was quite fair for distance learning. Homework deadlines are flexible. Highly recommend to all systems engineering distance-learning MEng students.I do not exaggerate but Professor Fengqi has exceeded all my expectations. We are talking about a TRUE teacher, who knows the subject, make you want to learn more and study. For assistance to DL students we are talking about daily support and care! In my eyes, he is a real top University professor and I feel very proud to be a member of his class.Professor You is very engaging and makes himself available to help. I enjoyed the course and his lectures.Professor You is a good professor, however I would say some reviews are very generous...Excellent professor. I have taken all of the classes that he offers and enjoyed every single on of them.Very engaging class and interesting applications. Professor is extremely knowledge about course topics and always ready to help. Great class overall. One of the best in the Systems Engineering Masters track.Prof. You&#39;s instruction and student focus is world class. His lectures are very engaging, and I like the technical content with the overlay of the historical significance.An excellent course.Prof. You learned our names and made an effort to extend help to anyone who needed it. The class was easy, even for those with no-coding background like myself. Learned a lot. The expectations aren&#39;t that high. If you take advantage of OHs and put in the effort on homeworks and project, easy A. Take his course if you can! Highly recommended!I can tell that Professor You cares that the students are learning the material. I appreciated that he gave us so much freedom in the project as it really enabled us to think about what we learned this past semester and how to apply it in a meaningful way. The hws were relevant and challenged us to think outside of the examples shown in the class.I was attracted to the course because of the certificate, but I now find the course much more useful to my work than I expected. Optimization has many applications to all fields, and the professor did a good job to cover the applications without too much hard theory, while making the course interesting enough to challenge us. Abundant office hours.You is the best professor Ive had so far, he is very caring and accommodating. Super easy grader. Insightful homeworks and fun in class lectures. He helped me a lot when I have questions after the class.A five-star professor! Very speedy replies to emails; generous in grading and deadline extension; amenable to all requests; helpful in organizing teams; exceptionally supportive and patient. He is a good reason for us to study at Cornell. TAs are great as well. Highly recommend this course to all DL students!Amazing professor! Plentiful of office hours! Wonderful teaching support! Very responsive replies to emails and piazza. I plan to take all his courses at SYSEN distance learning programThe course slides are very well prepared and were all that was needed in order to be successful in the course. The homeworks are very good resources or student to better understanding the course material. The lectures are well-structured and very clear. I appreciated and enjoyed course material being presented with many real world applications.Prof. You is the best professor I have had in my 22 credit hours of experience at Cornell. His lectures are engaging, course content is relevant and interesting, and gradings are fair. His focus on students and their success makes me appreciate my time at Cornell. He has set the standard to which all other course delivery should be measured.Prof. You is an excellent instructor. His command in Optimization topic is outstanding. The course slides\/materials are of high quality. Prof. has explained all the solving methods in detail and with examples. I can clearly connect these methods in Machine Learning, since machine learning is an enhancement of Optimization.Professor You organized his lecture slides by topic so we didn&#39;t have to open a million different slide decks to find the material to study. He provided so many real life examples of the material and their model formulations so the content felt especially applicable, relevant, and understandable.
