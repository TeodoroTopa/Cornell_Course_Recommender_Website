Local Rocchio:
When filter is turned on:
Extract saved course information from cloud (Vectorized)
Compute rel_doc centroid -> Sum and average
Add to query vector with some weight (needs tuning)
Do normal search

So what we need to do :)
- Can we make a dummy filter? Such that we have something that we can check for when implementing this
- Make sure that the saved course function, saves vectorized version of the courses.
- Write function that extracts this information from the cloud, when filter is active (and user is logged in)
