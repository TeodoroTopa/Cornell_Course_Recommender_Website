1) check information that is saved on DB
     - run a script to update the DB so it contains new values have
     - lots of work - may be worth it to skip?
    
2) reformat the database

3) dictionary --> pickle --> save to cloud (ourId --> vectorized rep, list consist of courses users have saved)
     -> 


the goal is to implement this globally
for each query, you have some saved courses that correspond
help other users get better results from the query (similar to hubs and authorities)
